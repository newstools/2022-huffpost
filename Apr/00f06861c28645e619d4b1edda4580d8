Conservatives couldn’t contain their glee at the quick demise of the streaming service CNN+. Fox News personalities as well as Donald Trump and his CNN-bashing allies took great delight in gloating over Warner Bros. Discovery’s decision to nix the platform just weeks after its launch. The cancellation puts hundreds of jobs at risk. Chris Wallace, who quit Fox News for CNN+ in December, drew much of the scorn. In a statement, Trump mocked CNN+ as “an empty desert” and blamed it for “spending hundreds of millions of dollars and the hiring of low-rated Chris Wallace, a man who tried so hard to be his father, Mike, but lacked the talent and whatever else is necessary to be a star.” Donald Trump Jr., the former president’s eldest son, shared this meme: Fox’s conspiracy theory-promoting prime time host Tucker Carlson mockingly mourned “the involuntary retirement of Mike Wallace’s son.” “Boo hoo, no more lectures on TV,” he said. Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld, meanwhile, said “the Democratic bench is thinner than Chris Wallace’s demo reel from CNN+.” Former Trump White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who is now a host on Fox News, declared that the service had “fallen to the dustbins of history.” “Even Tom Brady’s retirement lasted longer than CNN+,” added Fox’s Brian Kilmeade. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called the cancellation “poetry.” And former White House press secretary Sean Spicer, now a host on Newsmax, said it “didn’t even last a full Scaramucci.”
