MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — Police and the Memphis Zoo searched Thursday for a wallaby that was missing after heavy rain caused flooding inside an exhibit. The zoo said a creek in its KangaZoo exhibit overflowed during thunderstorms Wednesday, leading staff to evacuate animals to an animal hospital. After counting the animals, staff found that one wallaby was missing, and a search began, the zoo said in a news release. The Memphis Police Department is helping the search for the missing wallaby, which are smaller relatives of the kangaroo and are fairly skittish, the zoo said. Anyone who sees the wallaby is asked to call the zoo and describe the location and time where it was spotted.
