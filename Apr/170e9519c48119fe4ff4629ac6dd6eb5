Donald Trump Jr. previously railed against mask mandates aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, but former President Donald Trump’s eldest son admitted on Thursday that he would continue to mask up. Why? “For anonymity,” so he can “stay under the radar,” he wrote on Twitter. He’s not alone. Trump Jr.’s admission came as he questioned polling showing the majority of Americans support mask mandates on airplanes and trains after a federal judge struck down the federal coronavirus mask mandate on public transportation. The Department of Justice is appealing the ruling. “Must be a lib poll,” the Trump scion wrote, noting how “about 90%” of people he’d seen while flying out of airports in Miami and Cleveland this week weren’t wearing face coverings. “I’m sitting in an airport now and I can see 60+ people and can count 5 masks including me but I’m wearing one for anonymity not bc I think a small cloth does anything,” Trump Jr. added. Later, Trump Jr. responded to a tweet that exclaimed “the best part of lifting the mask mandate is that you can now tell with 100% certainty exactly how many libs are on your flight.” “99.9% I’ll keep wearing one so I can stay under the radar,” Trump replied. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention “continues to recommend that people wear masks in all indoor public transportation settings,” per its website. “When people wear a well-fitting mask or respirator over their nose and mouth in indoor travel or public transportation settings, they protect themselves, and those around them, including those who are immunocompromised or not yet vaccine-eligible, and help keep travel and public transportation safer for everyone,” the CDC says.
