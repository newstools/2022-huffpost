The 2022 Oscars reminded us just how unpredictable live award shows can be — but just a week later, the Grammy Awards delivered a joyful and performance-packed show that mostly stuck to the script. The 64th annual ceremony celebrating the past year in music aired live from Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena (instead of its usual home in Los Angeles) on Sunday night following a delay of more than two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. The show, hosted once again by Trevor Noah, who helmed last year’s heavily masked and distanced outdoor ceremony, thankfully didn’t feature the frenzy of a live onstage slap but highlighted plenty of all-star talent and buzzy moments, including a surprise appearance from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Jon Batiste, a genre-spanning recording artist and composer who also serves as the bandleader for “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” dominated the event, ultimately picking up the night’s top Album of the Year trophy for his record “We Are.” The Louisiana-born musician, who entered the show with a leading 11 nominations, scored four wins earlier in the pre-telecast ceremony before taking the stage with a rousing performance of his hit song “Freedom.” Silk Sonic, the duo made up of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, also won big, pulling off wins in all of their nominated categories, including Record of the Year and Song of Year for their sultry throwback jam “Leave the Door Open.” “We’re really trying our hardest to remain humble at this point,” .Paak said onstage after their final win. “But in the industry, we call that a clean sweep.” Powered by her chart-topping smash hit “Drivers License,” Olivia Rodrigo was coronated as the Best New Artist but didn’t find much success outside of the pop-specific categories. Meanwhile, Grammys’ reigning favorite Billie Eilish and her rock-tinged sophomore effort “Happier Than Ever” were completely shut out of the ceremony after historic back-to-back wins for Record of the Year. Avoiding the next chapter in their ever-evolving feud, Taylor Swift and Kanye West, who were both up for Album of the Year, were no-shows at the event. The rapper, who was barred from performing at the ceremony due to his “concerning online behavior” ― including a much-buzzed-about social media tussle with host Trevor Noah ― still managed to take home multiple awards, including Best Melodic Rap Performance and Best Rap Song. Aside from the golden gramophones, live performances were, of course, the event’s biggest draw. This year’s lineup included Rodrigo, Eilish, Lil Nas X, Lady Gaga, Silk Sonic, H.E.R., Brandi Carlile, Chris Stapleton, Brothers Osborne, as well as Cynthia Erivo, Ben Platt, Leslie Odom Jr. and Rachel Zegler, who joined forces for an “In Memoriam” segment to honor legendary Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim.
