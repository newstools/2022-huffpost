Apparently “cancel culture” isn’t a thing at the Grammys, and comedian Louis C.K. is the proof. The controversial comedian won a Grammy for Best Comedy Album with “Sincerely Louis CK.” In the process, he beat out other so-called canceled comedians Dave Chappelle and Kevin Hart. The Grammy win came despite the fact that the comedian is still dealing with a career scandal that began five years ago after he admitted to sexually harassing five women, whose stories were detailed in a New York Times story. The nomination and win were C.K.’s first since his accusers came forward in 2017, the Daily Beast reported.
