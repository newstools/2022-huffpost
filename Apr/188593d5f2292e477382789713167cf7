Caring for a newborn is no joke — if there’s any demographic of human being that needs extra pampering and love, it’s new moms. Facing challenges that range from sleep deprivation to healing from the ravages of childbirth and general overwhelm, it is nearly impossible for new moms to carve out time for themselves. And yet, we all know how important is to take the time to rest, recharge and recenter when it comes to having the capacity to care for others. You have to put the oxygen mask on yourself before you can put it on anyone else! That’s why we’re focusing on gifts for new moms, from the practical to the luxurious. So often, gifts for new moms tend to be baby-centric, but it’s important that they feel special and cared for during this delicate time as well. We rounded up gifts that help them to take a bit of time for themselves, encourage physical healing and comfort and can be used long after the baby is grown.
