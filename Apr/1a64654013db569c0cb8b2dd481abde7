Longtime New York Yankees broadcaster John Sterling calls them as he sees them ― and that’s not always a good thing. He went viral for his hilariously wrong description of a Giancarlo Stanton fly ball on Wednesday against the Toronto Blue Jays. (Check it out below.) As Stanton connected, the radio play-by-play veteran launched his signature home run riff: “That ball is high, it is far, it is gone!” he exclaimed. A few beats later, after realizing that Blue Jays outfielder Raimel Tapia recorded the out on the warning track, Sterling added: “But caught.” “It is gone!” “But caught.” Classic. “Boy I thought that was gone,” Sterling followed. Fans and critics on Twitter took their swings at Sterling. The Yankees lost 6-4, stung by three home runs hit by the Blue Jays’ Vladimir Guerrero Jr.
