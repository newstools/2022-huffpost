Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R) threw the subtlest of shade at Tucker Carlson after the Fox News personality dedicated an on-air diatribe against him and other state leaders. Carlson on Wednesday baselessly accused Cox of being a “creepy” liberal for answering a high school student’s questions about his preferred gender pronouns. “Spencer Cox identifies as a male, at least to some limited extent. Cox could’ve cleared up that mystery a lot more quickly simply by declaring, ‘I’m a man.’ Instead, he went full hostage video,” the conservative blowhard railed. In response, Cox liked the above tweet, which described Carlson as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “favorite white nationalist.” Carlson, a longtime peddler of white nationalist rhetoric, has received fierce criticism for repeating Russian talking points amid Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s state-run media have used Carlson’s rants as propaganda.
