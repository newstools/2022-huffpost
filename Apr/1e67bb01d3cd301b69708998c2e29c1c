Spring has sprung, and our taste buds are beginning to transition away from heavy, slow-cooked stews and more toward fresh, lighter fare. And if you take a look at April’s most-liked recipes on the HuffPost Taste Instagram account (which you should follow!), you’ll see just that. Below are the 10 recipes our followers like the most, including a lemon pesto burrata and brown butter gnocchi that makes for a perfect Friday night feast, and a new way to make salmon that involves creamed leeks and asparagus. If you’re thirsty, there’s a copycat recipe for Starbucks’ famous iced pistachio latte, and our personal favorite is a dish of crispy roasted potatoes with a creamy feta sauce. Take a look at the recipes and let us know your favorites in the comments!
