U.S. Capitol Police confirmed there was “no threat” to the Capitol after having ordered an evacuation of the complex over aircraft activity. The aircraft that caused alarm appeared to be carrying a U.S. Army parachute team that dropped into nearby Nationals Park at the start of a Washington Nationals baseball game for “military appreciation day,” according to multiple reports. On Wednesday evening, Capitol Police had sent an alert to congressional staffers saying they were “tracking an aircraft that poses a probable threat.” Shortly after, the Capitol Police then tweeted that the Capitol had been evacuated “out of an abundance of caution” and that there was “no threat.” Police said they would release more details later. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Federal Aviation Administration’s “apparent failure” to notify U.S. Capitol Police of the flight activities as “outrageous” and “inexcusable” in a statement late Wednesday. “The unnecessary panic caused by this apparent negligence was particularly harmful for Members, staff and institutional workers still grappling with the trauma of the attack on their workplace on January 6th,” Pelosi said, referring to the 2021 attack on the Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump.
