Liberals are warned to “beware” in Donald Trump Jr.’s latest display of macho bravado. Former President Donald Trump’s eldest son and Missouri GOP Senate candidate Eric Greitens fire automatic rifles at a shooting range in a new video shared online Monday. “Striking fear into the hearts of liberals everywhere, folks,” Trump Jr. says in the clip. “Liberals beware,” adds Greitens after he and Trump switch to semi-automatic pistols. Greitens resigned as governor of Missouri in 2018 amid sexual misconduct and campaign finance scandals. He has been accused by his ex-wife of physical abuse and “unstable and coercive behavior” to her and their children. Some critics ridiculed the clip. “OMG….. Testicle Tanning really works…..,” one wag fired back on Twitter, a mocking reference to Fox News personality Tucker Carlson’s special on masculinity. Others said they reported the video to law enforcement authorities as a threat.
