If you’ve been wanting to get your hands on the Our Place Always Pan, the best time to grab one is right now. From April 19-May 8, you can get one for $115, which is $30 less than its regular price. This huge discount is a part of Our Place’s spring sale, which also includes price markdowns on the Perfect Pot and 20% off utensils and accessories like the newly released Fry Deck. The only things not included in the sale are bundles, but you’ll get a better deal on the sum of these items with the 20% off discount anyway. These cookware staples are a must-have for every kitchen and recipe, especially if you’re low on storage space and are in need of a pan or pot that pretty much does it all. The Always Pan is designed to replace eight pieces of common cookware like a skillet, sauté pan, steamer and spoon rest, and the Perfect Pot serves as a replacement for a Dutch oven, stockpot, braiser, roasting rack and saucepot. But why have one, when you can have both? That’s where the Home Cook Duo comes in handy, which is $225 right now compared to its original price of $250. This set comes with the Always Pan and the Perfect Pot so you can live out your pro cooking dreams. Check out some of the standout items from the sale below and shop everything on fromourplace.com.
