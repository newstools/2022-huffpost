Jimmy Kimmel this week bid farewell to “viral videos of Karens and Aarons having anti-mask meltdowns in mid-air.” The late night comedian recognized “the very best of the very worst” clips following a federal judge’s ruling striking down federal coronavirus mask mandates on public transportation. Kimmel’s spoof “Unruly Awards” were given out for the following categories: Outstanding mask removal; outstanding use of expletives; outstanding white woman comparing herself to Rosa Parks; outstanding use of a substitute mask; outstanding use of packing materials and outstanding nonverbal protest. “Congratulations to all of our winners. Each of them will be getting rabies shots,” Kimmel cracked afterward. Check out the video here:
