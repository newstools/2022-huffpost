Joe Alwyn is aware there’s a blank space in regard to details about his relationship with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, and it’s likely going to stay that way — at least according to an interview with the “Conversations With Friends” star published by Elle last week. Alwyn told the magazine that he’s baffled by the public’s thirst for more tea about their private life — although, to be fair to Swifties, the “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together” singer has hinted at quite a few juicy tidbits from her prior relationships in her famous breakup ballads. “It’s not really [because I] want to be guarded and private, it’s more a response to something else,” Alwyn said. “We live in a culture that is so increasingly intrusive. … The more you give — and frankly, even if you don’t give it — something will be taken.” Swift seems to be equally committed to the couple’s interest in maintaining their privacy. This may be because her relationship with Alwyn allows her to feel like a regular, non-famous person in love — as she explained to Paul McCartney during an interview for Rolling Stone in 2020. “I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on,” she said. She added: “Whether that’s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture... it’s really just trying to find bits of normalcy.” Part of the reason Swift’s fans are so invested in her love life is her Carly Simon-like tendency to write incredibly intimate lyrics about past high-profile relationships. Although Swift plays coy about which of her past paramours inspired each song, she does make strong suggestions, often to the delight (or fury) of her fans. Regardless of Swift’s past, it’s nice to see the “Shake It Off” singer happy, in love and keeping the tea firmly in her cup with Alwyn.
