A California hiker who was missing for more than two weeks has been found dead, with the man’s loyal dog ― alive ― still by his side. The body of Oscar Alejandro Hernandez, 29, was found in a remote part of Griffith Park in Los Angeles on Thursday, NBC 4 reported. His family and friends reported him missing in mid-March, saying they were concerned for his safety. He was last seen on March 16, and a flyer circulated by his family said his last known location was near the hiking trails around the park’s merry-go-round. Hernandez’s family was present when his body was found, Los Angeles Sgt. Ruben Arellano told The Associated Press. His dog, King, was there next to him, emaciated but alive. The man’s cousin told NBC 4 he believes King never left Hernandez’s side. Multiple agencies worked to retrieve Hernandez’s body from the hilly area. Authorities have not yet released a cause of death for Hernandez, but there’s no reason to suspect foul play, Arellano said. Griffith Park covers more than 4,000 acres and includes around 50 miles of hiking trails, grassy areas and rugged chaparral hillsides.
