The rapper Rakim Mayers, better known by his stage name A$AP Rocky, was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on Wednesday morning in connection with a November shooting, police confirmed. Mayers, 33, was detained after landing on a private jet from Barbados with his girlfriend, the singer and business mogul Rihanna, TMZ and NBC News first reported. He faces a charge of assault with a deadly weapon, police said. The Los Angeles Police Department said Wednesday it began investigating Mayers after a shooting victim came forward accusing the rapper of approaching him on the street in the Hollywood area on Nov. 6. The victim alleged that as many as four shots were fired from a handgun, inflicting minor injuries and requiring the victim to seek medical attention. “Detectives worked diligently to investigate and corroborate the reporting information which helped identify the suspect(s) involved,” the department said Wednesday. “The suspect has been identified as 33-year-old Rakim Mayers, a Los Angeles resident, also known as music artist A$AP Rocky.” “The case will be presented to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office for filing consideration,” the LAPD’s statement added. Rihanna is pregnant with the couple’s first child. She revealed last month that she’s currently in her third trimester. A lawyer for Mayers did not immediately return HuffPost’s request for comment.
