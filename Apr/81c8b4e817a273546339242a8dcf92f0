Fox News’ Geraldo Rivera cheered Elon Musk’s purchase of Twitter on Tuesday. But the veteran conservative commentator said he had one worry regarding the Tesla CEO’s takeover of the social media platform. “I fear only this, this is the one caveat I’ll bring up,” Rivera told prime-time host Sean Hannity. “If Donald Trump persists in insisting he will not be on Twitter, and opting to be on Truth, I think Elon Musk would have overpaid for Twitter.” Trump has pitched his struggling Truth Social platform as a conservative alternative to Twitter. Twitter “with Trump is a far more exotic product it seems to me than the opposite,” Rivera added. Trump was permanently banned from Twitter after inciting the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021. Musk’s acquisition has prompted speculation that Trump may be allowed to return to the site. However, the former president said he won’t return to Twitter and will instead remain on his faltering Truth Social. Trump has made just one post on Truth Social since its wobbly launch in February.
