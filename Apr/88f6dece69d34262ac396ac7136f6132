She was also crowned for Best R&B Performance in a tie with Silk Sonic. “Shoutout to Black women who are out there living their lives,” Sullivan said as she accepted her award. The powerhouse songstress scored three Grammy nominations, including Best R&B Performance, Best R&B Album for “Heaux Tales” and Best R&B Song for “Pick Up Your Feelings,” which topped Billboard’s Adult R&B Airplay chart and became Sullivan’s first chart-topper.

See u there!” The R&B star’s “Heaux Tales” tour will last through July.
