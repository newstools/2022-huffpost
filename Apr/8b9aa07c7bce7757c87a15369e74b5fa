One of 2005’s most buzzed-about blockbusters nearly had a different leading lady. Appearing Thursday on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” Gwen Stefani briefly recalled auditioning for the part of Jane Smith in “Mr. & Mrs. Smith.” Angelina Jolie went on to play the role in the film, which also starred Brad Pitt. “Angelina beat me,” the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter quipped as the audience collectively gasped. And though she didn’t disclose any specifics about the audition, she added, “That could’ve been a different story.” Watch Gwen Stefani’s appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” below. “Mr. & Mrs. Smith,” directed by Doug Limon, follows a bored suburban couple whose marriage is thrown into a tailspin after they discover they are assassins for competing agencies and have been assigned to kill each other. The movie was a critical and commercial smash, reportedly raking in $486 million at the box office worldwide. Its production, however, was a publicity frenzy given that it marked the start of Pitt’s romance with Jolie while he was still married to actor Jennifer Aniston. Though Stefani’s unsuccessful “Mr. & Mrs. Smith” tryout appeared to come as a surprise to most of DeGeneres’s audience, she’s touched on the subject before. “It was between me and Angelina Jolie, and I’m like, ‘Oh, great. I got a shot here,’” she said of the project in a 2008 Vogue interview. “The whole acting thing really feels like something I could do. Whenever I’ve done it, whenever I had moments where it works, it’s just like performing. You hit a moment. And that’s what movies are: a series of moments.” And while Stefani missed out on the part of Jane Smith, she did score a 2005 Screen Actors Guild Award nomination as part of the ensemble cast of Martin Scorsese’s “The Aviator,” starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
