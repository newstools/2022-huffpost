The fifth in line to the British throne turned 4 on Saturday. Kate Middleton and Prince William marked their youngest son Prince Louis’ birthday by sharing a series of photographs the Duchess of Cambridge took of him on a beach near their Norfolk home of Anmer Hall. The barefoot royal holds a cricket ball and appears to run into bowl in two of the images. Another shows him sitting down and smiling, wearing a gray sweatshirt with multicolored stars.
