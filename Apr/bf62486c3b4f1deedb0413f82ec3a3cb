The Washington Post on Tuesday praised President Joe Biden for restoring what it described as “a sense of dignity” to the presidential pardon process. In an editorial, the newspaper offered a damning contrast between Biden’s “care in determining who should benefit from clemency” to former President Donald Trump, who doled out pardons to “personal associates convicted of or on trial for serious offenses,” those with White House connections or people who had celebrity advocates. It shows “what a tremendous upgrade” Biden is from Trump, the editorial said. The headline riffed on the “upgrade” theme too: “Biden shows once again why he is a huge upgrade from Trump.” On Tuesday, Biden pardoned a former Secret Service agent and two people convicted on drug-related charges, and commuted the sentences of 75 others for nonviolent, drug-related offenses. Trump “made the presidential pardon power seem arbitrary and unchecked,” the Post’s editorial concluded, saying Biden “is right to restore a sense of dignity and fairness to its exercise.” Read the full editorial here.
