When it comes to shopping, searching for a bathing suit can be among the most stressful experiences. Not only are cute, well-fitting, comfortable swimsuits difficult to find, but trying them on can a not-so-fun experience, either (thanks, fitting room lighting). On top of all of that, bathing suits can sometimes be wildly expensive. All this is to say that it can be very tempting to stick to an old, trusty one piece instead of attempting to find new, trendy styles and silhouettes of bathing suits. Target, however, makes it just a little bit easier to experiment and find new, affordable one pieces and bikinis that you can actually feel excited about. Here are 13 of the best Target swimsuits you can buy right now. HuffPost receives a share from retailers on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team.
