More than 300 dogs were found dead in an animal shelter in Ukraine after weeks without food or water, an animal charity has reported. The 485 animals in the Borodyanka shelter were locked in their cages from the start of the war in late February until just days ago when Russian troops finally left and workers could get back inside, UAnimals said.
