Fox News host Jesse Watters’ concept of romance is striking many people as creepy. Last Monday, Watters told his co-hosts on “The Five” how he managed to woo his wife, Emma — who was a younger producer working on his show at the time — by sabotaging her car. “When I was trying to get Emma to date me, the first thing I did was let the air out of her tires,” Watters said. “She couldn’t go anywhere. She needed a lift, I said, ‘You need a lift?’ She hopped right in the car.” Watters’ co-hosts were shocked. “You’re basically the Zodiac Killer,” Greg Gutfeld exclaimed. “It has a happy ending,” Watters said, a reference to the fact he married her in 2020 (even though he was married when they first met). Jeannine Pirro had one big question: “Is that the first time you did it, or did you use that before?” Watters sheepishly said, “It works like a charm.” You can see the segment below. Many Twitter users didn’t think Watters’ method of coercion or manipulation was as romantic as he did.
