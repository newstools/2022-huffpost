Joe Biden went to Iowa on Tuesday to announce the suspension of a federal rule preventing the sale of higher ethanol blend gasoline , but all anyone is talking about is the supposed bird poop attack. The president was speaking at a manufacturing plant in Menlo when a small white drop fell down on his blue suit jacket just above the pocket. Some people ― especially Republicans ― immediately thought the president was being pooped on. And much like the fly that appeared on Mike Pence’s head during the 2020 vice presidential debate, the possible poop inspired lots of Twitter snark from the GOP and other Biden bashers. However, the Des Moines Register said that while there were birds in the giant silo where Biden was speaking, the white substance that fell on Biden’s jacket was actually distillers grain, which it said was a co-product of the ethanol production process. Bloomberg reporter Justin Sink ― who was at the event ― also said the stuff that dropped on Biden was a bit of corn as well. The White House naturally said it was the less crappy substance. On Wednesday, “Fox & Friends” co-host Steve Doocy had questions about what he called “birdpoopgate” for his son, White House correspondent Peter Doocy. “When the president started off talking about blaming the Putin price hike, a bird pooped on him. At what point did he realize that that had happened?” the elder Doocy asked, according to Mediaite.com . “Hopefully, before he puts that jacket on again,” his son joked.
