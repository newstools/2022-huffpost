Police have shared the identities of the three suspects who allegedly kidnapped a 3-month-old baby in California while his grandmother unloaded groceries from her car. The infant has since been rescued and returned to his family. The San Jose Police Department released mug shots on Wednesday of Jose Roman Portillo, 28, Yesenia Guadalupe Ramirez, 43, and Baldomeo Sandoval, 37, alleging they conspired to take the baby. All three are in police custody after being detained on Tuesday. The baby’s grandmother reported him missing around 1 p.m. Monday after she had briefly left him inside her home to unload groceries, San Jose Police Sgt. Christian Camarillo told NBC Bay Area. Police released a video clip that shows a man walking down the sidewalk holding a child car seat covered by a white blanket. Police identified Portillo as the suspect who “unlawfully entered the residence and kidnapped the infant,” according to the department’s press release. Ramirez had been with the grandmother prior to the kidnapping, the release said. Authorities said she became a person of interest after her “statement changed several times” when she spoke to authorities. Sandoval was later identified as an additional suspect and detained after police gathered evidence and interviewed him. Police apprehended Portillo on Tuesday in his San Jose residence and found the baby there. The infant “appeared to be healthy and unharmed,” police said. He was transported to a local hospital as a precaution and reunited with his family. “This incident is a parent’s worst nightmare,” Chief of Police Anthony Mata said in a statement in the release. The department also encouraged any person with additional information about the suspects to reach out to detectives, using the contact information in the press release.
