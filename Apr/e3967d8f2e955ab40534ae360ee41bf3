Was Tom Holland secretly in “Euphoria”? Holland, 25, has expressed interest in appearing on HBO’s hit series alongside girlfriend, Zendaya, who stars as the series’ most complicated and compelling character, Rue. And during a recent interview with Access Hollywood, Zendaya, 25, was vague about whether there was any truth to the rumor that Holland had made a cameo on the show. “Could be,” she said. “Can’t confirm or deny,” added Zendaya. “The world may never know.” So, when can fans expect to see Holland in the series? He has reportedly been pining for the opportunity since last December. “Listen, I have been petitioning for this for a long time,” he told IMDb. “It has not happened yet and I’m very disappointed. I must have come to visit ‘Euphoria’ at least 30 times this season.” After the show’s second season premiered, fans tried zeroing in on scenes in hopes of spotting Holland lurking in the background as an extra, especially during episode 7 when Lexi (Maude Apatow)’s play debuted. Zendaya also joked that they should’ve tried to add Holland’s cameo as an “easter egg” for fans to discover. “OK, let me talk to some people. HBO! Let’s get them on the phone,” she said. Holland kept up the charade. “I would be in ‘Euphoria.’ I think I would be a really good Maddy,” he told Buzzfeed, nodding to Alexa Demie’s character. “I’m a big ‘Euphoria’ fan. I love the show and I love season two. I visited a lot while they were shooting it and I really, really enjoyed it.”
