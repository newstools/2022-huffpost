A retired federal judge appointed by former President George H.W. Bush warned in an opinion piece published by CNN on Wednesday that Republicans are “already a long way toward recapturing the White House in 2024, whether Trump or another Republican candidate wins the election or not.” In his essay, J. Michael Luttig broke down what he called the “Republican blueprint” to steal the 2024 election ― the cornerstone of which, he said, was the Supreme Court’s embrace of the “independent state legislature” doctrine. The 2020 election fraud lies peddled by former President Donald Trump and his allies are just “the shiny object that Republicans have tauntingly and disingenuously dangled before the American public for almost a year and a half now to distract attention from their far more ambitious objective,” wrote Luttig. Their actual objective, said Luttig, was “to execute successfully in 2024 the very same plan they failed in executing in 2020 and to overturn the 2024 election if Trump or his anointed successor loses again in the next quadrennial contest.” “The last presidential election was a dry run for the next,” cautioned Luttig, who in January 2021 advised then-Vice President Mike Pence against assisting Trump in delaying President Joe Biden’s win.
