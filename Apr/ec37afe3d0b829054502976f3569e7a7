Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) imagined he might have to take peyote and be nude for an upcoming speaking engagement at that bastion of liberal hedonism, Yale University. Twitter foes, unfortunately, couldn’t shake the image. Cruz, a graduate of Princeton and Harvard, meant to diss Yale on “The Liz Wheeler Show” and his own “Verdict With Ted Cruz” podcast when he said Yale would probably require him to (initially) be in a “smoking jacket with maybe a Sherlock Holmes pipe and maybe some Madeira.” He mused: “Or, I don’t know, has it gone more hippie than that? Like, nude and taking peyote or something.” Cruz is taping his “Verdict” podcast on stage in mid-April before a live student audience at Yale. TMI, said Twitter critics.
