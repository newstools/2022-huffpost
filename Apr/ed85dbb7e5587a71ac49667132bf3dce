House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) appears to be returning as a guest star on “RuPaul’s Drag Race.” Pelosi was featured in a trailer for the upcoming all-winners season that Paramount+ released online Friday. “Can I get an amen?” she said toward the end of the teaser clip, repeating one of host RuPaul’s catchphrases. Supermodel Naomi Campbell, actors Kirby Howell-Baptiste and Cameron Diaz, journalist Ronan Farrow, comedian Nikki Glaser and singer Tove Lo also appear in the spot. Watch the trailer here: Pelosi made a cameo on “RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars” in 2018, an experience she described as “fabulous” and in solidarity with the LGBTQ community amid attacks by Donald Trump’s administration. “You’re an inspiration ― I hope you know ― because you really know your power,” Pelosi told the queens at the time. “It’s about taking pride. And that’s what you do ― take pride in yourselves.” “RuPaul’s Drag Race: All Stars” streams on Paramount+ from May 20.
