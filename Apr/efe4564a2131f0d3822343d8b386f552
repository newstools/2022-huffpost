“Weekend Update’s” co-host Colin Jost found it hilarious that Will Smith has been banned for ten years from the Oscars as punishment for striking Chris Rock on stage. “Is that a punishment?” asked a perplexed Jost on “Saturday Night Live’s” faux news program. “He can still be nominated and win an award. He can even go to the after-party. He just doesn’t have to attend the four-hour ceremony where someone is definitely going to make fun of his wife again,” Jost quipped. A real punishment would be to make Smith host next year’s Oscars, said Jost, who hosted the 2018 Emmys awards show with Michael Che. “Trust me,” he said. “Nothing will make you question your choices in life more than hosting an awards show.” Check it out — and other “news” — in the video clip up top.
