Betty Gilpin’s acting career got off to an inauspicious start. The “Gaslit” star’s very first gig ― on “Law & Order” — saw her accidentally left in a body bag, she recalled on Thursday’s episode of “The Tonight Show.” Gilpin remembered being zipped up in the bag while Vincent D’Onofrio “had like a grumbly scene” over it. But when the crew called “cut,” they apparently forgot all about her and left her inside. “I hear footsteps on gravel getting farther and farther away. Van doors closing,” she told host Jimmy Fallon. “And then 10 seconds goes by, I hear one faraway PA being like, ‘Oh my God.’ Footsteps coming towards me … unzip … sunlight in my face … ‘Let’s get you out of there.’” Fallon mimicked Gilpin calling for help. “No, I didn’t want to be high maintenance,” she responded. “I wanted to work again the same season.” Watch the full interview here:
