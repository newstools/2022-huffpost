Parents who desire an active lifestyle know the struggle of balancing taking care of their kids and getting in adequate workouts. If this sounds like you, you’re probably looking for ways to combine the two. That’s where having a good jogging stroller comes in. Even though these strollers are designed for use while jogging, they can also serve as everyday strollers if speed walking or jogging isn’t your thing. Their features include flexible, reclining seats in which little ones can lie or sit upright, storage space to hold on-the-go essentials and swivel front wheels that lock in place for convenience. Some even come with the ability to turn into travel systems by allowing you to place a stroller-compatible infant car seat into the seat of the stroller. (If you already have a car seat you want to travel with, it’s extremely important to make sure it will properly fit in the jogging stroller you select.) Below, we rounded up seven of the best jogging strollers that have outstanding five-star reviews on Amazon. HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.
