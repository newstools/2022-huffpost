We can learn a great deal about Black history through books, films, classes and countless educational resources online. But a particularly powerful way to take in this history is by physically immersing yourself in it. In honor of Black History Month, we’ve rounded up 14 U.S. cities that were home to iconic figures and pivotal moments in Black history and culture. From Montgomery to Memphis to the Motor City, there are plenty of significant sites to explore. This list is by no means comprehensive, but we hope it can inspire your Black history travels ― both in February and throughout the year.
