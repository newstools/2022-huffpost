Early photos of smoke, fire, bodies and bloodshed have emerged following the start of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s military incursion into Ukraine, offering a small but powerful glimpse into the wide-ranging attack that’s left the country’s cities and military bases battling a barrage of deadly air and missile strikes. The photos, taken mere hours after Russia launched its first assaults in the early hours of Thursday morning, come as Russia carries out a long-anticipated invasion of the former Soviet republic. The attacks first started from the air, and Ukrainian authorities later reported ground assaults as well. Russian troops crossed Ukraine’s borders from the north, east and south, and explosions were reported in regions throughout the country, including in the capital of Kyiv. There, photos appear to show Russian military helicopters flying on the outskirts of the city and a Ukrainian military aircraft smoldering in a field after it was shot down. Other photos, taken outside of the capital, show blasted apartment complexes, wounded and dead civilians, and others attempting to flee. Here is a selection of those photos. NOTE: Some may be disturbing.
