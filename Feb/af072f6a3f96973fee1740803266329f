The 53rd NAACP Image Awards has arrived. The show went forward in the third year of the coronavirus pandemic with a televised two-hour live special airing Saturday night on BET but without an in-person audience. Winners in a number of categories were announced in non-televised virtual events in the week before Saturday’s ceremony, from Monday to Friday. “Black-ish” star Anthony Anderson ― a seven-time NAACP Image Award winner ― returned to host the ceremony Saturday. Anderson hosted the show from a studio in Los Angeles, while presenters and awardees made both in-person and virtual appearances. The NAACP Image Awards, which “celebrates the outstanding achievements and performances of people of color,” added four new podcast categories this year: Outstanding News and Information Podcast, Outstanding Lifestyle/Self-Help Podcast, Outstanding Society and Culture Podcast, and Outstanding Arts and Entertainment Podcast. Winners in major categories were announced on Saturday night, including awards for Outstanding Motion Picture, Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture, Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture and Entertainer of the Year. Will Smith took home the Outstanding Actor award for his role in “King Richard,” and Jennifer Hudson won Entertainer of the Year and the Outstanding Actress award for “Respect.” Netflix’s “The Harder They Fall” won Outstanding Motion Picture. Smith also joined Jemele Hill and Nikole Hannah-Jones, who were among the list of winners who were named in the first virtual event on Monday night, which covered packed literary and podcast categories. Hannah-Jones, who won in the Outstanding Literary Work – Nonfiction category for her book “The 1619 Project: A New Origin Story, ” was also selected to receive the Social Justice Impact award presented Saturday night. During her acceptance speech, she called out the ongoing Republican-backed efforts to ban critical race theory in schools across the U.S., saying “our history is being attacked.” Other special honorees included Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who are recipients of the President’s Award, and Samuel L. Jackson, who was given the Chairman’s Award.
