With the untelevised and controversy-plagued Golden Globes behind us and a slimmed down Academy Awards on the horizon, the Screen Actors Guild Awards might just be the most uncomplicated stop this awards season. Returning to an in-person ceremony after last year’s completely virtual pre-taped special, the 28th annual show is set to bring some of Hollywood’s biggest (and vaccinated) stars under one roof to honor work across film and television. As the first major event ahead of next month’s Academy Awards, the SAGs will deliver a boost to Oscar contenders in the acting categories ― the ceremony is a mostly reliable predictor for who will take home the coveted gold hardware ― and some much-needed clarity for pop culture fans and pundits alike. Airing live on Sunday from Santa Monica Airport’s Barker Hanger, the SAGs will see Kenneth Branagh’s semi-autobiographical film “Belfast” and “CODA,” the big-hearted coming of age dramedy from Sian Heder, compete against Adam McKay’s star-packed apocalypse comedy “Don’t Look Up,” Ridley Scott’s “House of Gucci” and Reinaldo Marcus Green’s tennis biopic “King Richard” for the night’s top best ensemble prize. Scott’s crime drama was overlooked in the Oscar best picture race, but led the nominations with Lady Gaga competing for best female actor alongside Nicole Kidman Kidman (“Being the Ricardos”), Jessica Chastain (“The Eyes of Tammy Faye”), Olivia Colman (“The Lost Daughter”) and Jennifer Hudson (“Respect”). Kristen Stewart, who was considered to be a shoe-in for her turn as Princess Diana in “Spencer,” surprisingly failed to earn a nod. Will Smith (“King Richard”), Denzel Washington (“The Tragedy of Macbeth”) and Benedict Cumberbatch (“The Power of the Dog”) are the heavyweights in the best male actor field, which also includes Javier Bardem (“Being the Ricardos”) and Andrew Garfield (“tick, tick... BOOM!”). As for television, reigning Emmys winners “Succession” and “Ted Lasso” are set to dominate once again with each up for five nominations apiece. Streaming services made a particularly strong showing this year. Series hailing from Apple TV+, Hulu and Netflix, including “Only Murders in the Building,” “Dopesick” “The Great” “Maid” and “Squid Game” ― the first foreign-language series to be recognized in major categories ― also raked in plenty of nominations. Kate Winslet, a frontrunner for her performance in HBO’s “Mare of Easttown,” will also be on hand to present the 57th SAG Life Achievement Award to Helen Mirren, who stands as the guild’s most decorated recipient to date, with a total of 13 SAG Award nominations and five wins.
