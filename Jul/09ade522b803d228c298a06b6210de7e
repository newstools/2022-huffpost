It may not be the biggest debate in the galaxy, but plenty of “Star Wars” fans have wondered over the years: How, exactly, do you pronounce “AT-AT.” Is it like @-@... or do you say each letter, A-T-A-T? Screen icon Mark Hamill offered some help after the official Twitter account for the storied franchise recently joked about the imperial walkers with a poll in which the answer was “AT-AT” either way: The tweet drew thousands of replies and retweets, with writer Tara Dublin asking Hamill for his take: But he wasn’t done. He added another message, and briefly pinned it to his profile, that indicates there may not be a right answer to any of the names and pronunciations ― and that comes straight from creator George Lucas: The franchise has embraced Lucas’ vision in this regard. As Screen Rant noted in 2020, longtime Lucasfilm insider Dave Filoni spoke out on the topic at a Star Wars event in 2016. “You can say at-at, you can say A-T-A-T, and you can say walker. I’m for all three,” he was quoted as saying. “That’s canon because in [“The Clone Wars”] I have imperials say walkers, I have them say at-at, and I have them say A-T-A-T.”
