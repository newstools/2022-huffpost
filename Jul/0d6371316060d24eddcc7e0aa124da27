Famed for their sleek designs and high functionality, Japanese kitchen brand Zojirushi is offering sales on some of their best-selling items, just for this final day of Amazon Prime. Although this beloved company tends to fly under the radar here in the U.S., Zojirushi’s rice cookers, stainless steel lunch jars and vibrant collection of vacuum-insulated water bottles are hugely popular in Japan — and now is your chance to try them out for yourself on the cheap. FYI — deals move quickly on Prime Day. We’ll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can’t catch everything immediately. Check back throughout Prime Day to see our latest updates as the deals change.
