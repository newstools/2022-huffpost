Ken Jennings’ light quip about circumcision on “Jeopardy!” Monday had some fans tipping their hats to the interim co-host. (Watch the video below.) For the category “Active Bible Verses” the clue read: “Since no one had done this for 40 years, God told Joshua to get a knife and do this to male Israelites.” “What is, uh, circumcise?” Erica Weiner-Amachi answered. “That is correct. A painful $2,000 for you!” Jennings cracked back. Weiner-Amachi would later experience the pain of losing a tie-breaker to new champ William Chou. Some fans, however, focused on the cutting remark of Jennings ― who’s sharing hosting duties with Mayim Bialik for this season ― in his return from an absence.
