Spending a leisurely sunny day in the park with friends is the stuff summer dreams are made of. Just picture it: There’s a picnic basket full of food, the rosé is flowing and you may or may not start up a casual game of Frisbee. But in order to make this fantasy a reality, you can’t exactly show up to the park empty handed. First, make a pit stop by Walmart (or better yet, plan ahead and get everything delivered) for everything you need. Would it be a stretch to call yourself the hero of your friend group? Not when they see what you show up with. HuffPost receives a share from purchases made via links on this page. Every item is independently selected by the HuffPost Shopping team.
