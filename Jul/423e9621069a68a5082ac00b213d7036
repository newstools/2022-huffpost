Eric R. Holder Jr., the man responsible for killing rapper Nipsey Hussle in March 2019, has been convicted of first-degree murder. For six hours, jurors deliberated on the fate of Holder, who fatally shot the legendary rapper in front of his Marathon clothing store in South Los Angeles in March 2019. Both Holder and Hussle grew up together and were a part of the Rollin’ 60s street gang in South Los Angeles. They had a brief conversation before the shooting in which Hussle accused Holder of being an “informant,” which carries a negative connotation in gang culture. Holder then returned with two handguns and shot Hussle “at least 10 times before kicking him in the head,” according to the The New York Times. He was also found guilty of two counts of attempted manslaughter for injuring two bystanders during the shooting. Attempted manslaughter carries a less severe punishment than the attempted murder charges prosecutors brought against Holder. Holder is facing life in prison. His sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 15. Holder’s lawyer Aaron Jansen described the shooting the result of a “heat of passion” within Holder, prompting him to believe he was not guilty of first-degree murder, as reported by The Associated Press. The murder trial, which lasted for over three weeks, took place in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. As the verdict was read, Holder had no visible reaction, according to AP. HuffPost reached out to Hussle’s management team for more information but did not immediately hear back.
