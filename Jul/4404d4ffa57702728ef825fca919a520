The series is the first live-action show in the “Resident Evil” action-horror franchise based on the popular Japanese video games. It premiered on July 14 and stars Ella Balinska as Jade Wesker, one of the few remaining survivors of a zombie apocalypse. “Stranger Things,” another show that dabbles in the horror genre, is in second place.
