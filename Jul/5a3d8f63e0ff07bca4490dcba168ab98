Yardwork might be on your to-do list this weekend and beyond ― including cutting that lawless front lawn that has been prompting side-eye from your neighbors. And whether you’re new to lawn-ownership or are in the running to receive the HOA’s Yard of the Month award, choosing the lawn mower that meets your specific needs and preferences can be a bit overwhelming.  That’s why we turned to the people who have actually purchased, used and reviewed the highly-rated grass-choppers on the following list. We covered a variety of categories, from the best budget-conscious options to mowers that can tackle tough terrain. Find an eco-friendly electric mower that isn’t afraid of hills and tall grass, an affordable reel mower that’s as low maintenance as they come or a traditional gas-powered option that is perfect for smaller sized lawns.
