Popular items from this list include: A pack of battery-operated portable LED bulbs kids can conveniently clip onto their bunk beds when they need light for late-night reading (or pillow fights — shh, it’s OK, we won’t tell). Plus, these are way cuter than a normal flashlight.   A truly ingenious two-in-one Mist ’N Sip water bottle that’ll quench thirst and spray a fine mist to keep them cool during a day of nonstop fun in the sun.    Or a teeny but mighty portable misting fan to provide a refreshing mist and cooling breeze when temps soar, while the soft kid-friendly blades won’t accidentally injure little fingers.
