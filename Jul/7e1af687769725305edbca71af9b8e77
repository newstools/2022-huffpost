Lindsay Lohan has tied the knot. “I am the luckiest woman in the world,” she captioned an Instagram photo of herself and financier Bader Shammas on Saturday. “You found me and knew that I wanted to find happiness and grace, all at the same time. I am stunned that you are my husband.” She also called Shammas “my life and my everything” and added that “every woman should feel like this every day.” People and E! News confirmed that the two are officially married. The “Mean Girls” star had announced her engagement to Shammas in November, after the couple had been dating for two years. Lohan has been living in Dubai for the past several years, and Shammas is an assistant vice president at Credit Suisse in the United Arab Emirates. Saturday was also Lohan’s birthday, and the 36-year-old shared a birthday post from Shammas via her Instagram stories that showed her dining by the water.
