There’s only one day left of Amazon Prime Day, and so far, we’ve seen our readers take full advantage of some long-awaited deals that they may not see for another 12 long months. Now, we’re in the final stretch of Amazon’s biggest sale of the year, which means it’s your last chance to snag of some of the most sought-after products for yourself, while also saving a ton of money. Based on the anonymous shopping stats that we pore over during Prime Day, we’re seeing that HuffPost readers are curious about the culinary wonders of an Instant Pot air fryer and have strong desires to make a frothy cappuccino right in the comfort of their kitchens. There also seems to be a large population of hot sleepers in search of the cooling capabilities of a Casper mattress. For anyone who’s feeling overwhelmed in the decision-making process, know that everything we’ve gathered in this list is a tried and true favorite among both our editors and HuffPost readers. Ahead, find everything from the Mercedes Benz of electric toothbrushes to clinical skin care, robot vacuums and even an ancestry kit.     FYI: Deals move quickly on Prime Day. We’ll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can’t catch everything immediately. Check back throughout Prime Day to see our latest updates as the deals change.      HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.
