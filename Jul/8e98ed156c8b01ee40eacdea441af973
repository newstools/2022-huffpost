Crosby, Stills & Nash is back on Spotify after band members requested their music be removed from the streaming service to protest podcaster Joe Rogan in February, Billboard reported. The music supergroup — featuring members David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash — announced their intention to leave Spotify after friend and fellow band member Neil Young pulled his music in January. The band members, in a joint statement, said they agreed with Young’s concerns of Rogan spreading “dangerous disinformation” about the COVID-19 pandemic through his podcast. “While we always value alternate points of view, knowingly spreading disinformation during this global pandemic has deadly consequences,” the band wrote. “Until real action is taken to show that a concern for humanity must be balanced with commerce, we don’t want our music — or the music we made together — to be on the same platform.” The band’s music was back on Spotify as of Saturday, Billboard said. The three members have decided to donate streaming proceeds to “COVID-19 charities for at least a month,” the magazine said. Crosby, Stills & Nash formed its folk rock supergroup in 1968 and, one year later, Young joined them to form Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. The band has been dormant since 2015 and, in recent years, members have been critical of one another. Past critical remarks, however, didn’t stop band members from coming together over their feelings on Rogan earlier this year. Young’s comments on the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast host came after doctors, scientists, professors and health care workers criticized Rogan for spreading COVID-19 misinformation . Young, along with Joni Mitchell, pulled his music from the streaming service to protest Rogan in January. “They can have Rogan or Young. Not both,” Young wrote in a letter at the time.
