Picture this: It’s the middle of summer. You go for a long walk, or spend an hour mowing the lawn, or go for a long bike ride. The whole time, all you can think of is the ice cold beverage you are going to drink when you get home. You walk in the door, looking forward to the refreshment ... only to find that that beer or soda or sports drink isn’t cold at all. And there’s nothing less refreshing than a room temperature (or worse, warm) beverage. That’s where the Chill-O-Matic Instant Beverage Chiller comes in. In fewer than 60 seconds, this thing can take a room temperature beer or can of soda to ice cold. According to the brand, that’s approximately 240 times faster than a refrigerator. But who’s counting? If you have a small refrigerator or you’re constantly forget to put that bottle of wine on ice before dinnertime, this thing could be your new summertime best friend.
