The nonprofit Adopt a Classroom surveyed 5400 teachers about the 2020-2021 school year, and those teachers spent an average of $750 out of pocket on school supplies. That’s the highest amount ever. 30% of teachers spent $1000 or more. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 94% of all public school teachers spent some of their own money on classroom supplies, with an average not-reimbursed spend of $478 — and that was back in the 2014-2015 school year. That’s why we asked teachers on BuzzFeed to share their Amazon Wish Lists with you, our readers, so we can all support them together this Prime Day, when some of the items might be on sale. We received significantly more responses than we expected — which shows the level of need — so we’ll continue to find ways to highlight different teachers and their wishlists over the next few months. Amazon Wish Lists are relatively simple to shop from, especially if you’re buying off of one Wish List at a time. For buying off of one Wish List at a time: you simply click into the Wish List, add as many items to cart as you’d like to purchase for that teacher, and go to check out. Amazon will ask you which address to ship to; select the teacher’s hidden gift address. Finish your checkout, where Amazon will charge your account for the gift. For buying off of multiple Wish Lists at a time: As you’re adding items to your cart from different teachers Wish Lists, keep track of which teacher requested which item. When you check out, Amazon will ask you which address to ship to; click “Ship to multiple addresses” near the top right. Then, use the drop down menus to assign the correct teacher’s address to each item. From there you can finish checkout, and Amazon will charge your account for all of it.
