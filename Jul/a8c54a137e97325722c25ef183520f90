If you want to have yourself a delicious buffet of grilled-up goodness, or just want to make a tasty weekday meal without dirtying up the kitchen, a few things from the following list might just be your new grilling BFF. Pick yourself up a tangy South Carolina-famous BBQ mustard sauce, a grill-top cast iron smoker box to inject your meats with flavor and a meat thermometer so accurate that the professionals use it for themselves.
