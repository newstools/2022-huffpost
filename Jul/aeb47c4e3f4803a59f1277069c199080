Baseball legend Jackie Robinson received a Hollywood-level tribute from fans of his former team on Tuesday. Prior to the MLB All-Star Game at Dodgers Stadium, actor Denzel Washington remembered Robinson — who broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball — on the 75th anniversary of his inaugural season with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Washington pointed out where Robinson’s MLB career began: Ebbets Field, the Brooklyn, New York, home of the Dodgers before their move to Los Angeles in 1958. “When Jackie Robinson stepped onto a Major League Baseball field for the first time, armed with supreme talent and unshakable character, and wearing a Dodgers uniform, he changed the game of baseball and so much more,” Washington said. “He said that life is not a spectator sport, and he lived that motto to the fullest,” Washington continued. Robinson died in 1972 at age 53. Other participants in the tribute wished Robinson’s widow, Rachel Robinson, a happy 100th birthday.
