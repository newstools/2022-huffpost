Actor Mark Hamill spotted a familiar sight for “Star Wars” fans that NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope apparently overlooked this week. Hamill tweeted one of the telescope’s first full-color images that shows a forceful object in the frame. The telescope transmitted an incredibly sharp image last week of a 4.6 billion-year-old galaxy cluster that NASA described as the “deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date.” Hamill, who played the Death Star-crushing Luke Skywalker in “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope,” wrote “#BeenThere___DestroyedThat” alongside a slightly edited version. You can check out Hamill’s tweet below. NASA, the European Space Agency and Canadian Space Agency have shared a number of images from the $10 billion telescope this week. These include glimpses of NGC 3132, known informally as the Southern Ring nebula, showing a star NASA describes as “cloaked in dust,” and an image of the colorful, mountainous landscape of NGC 3324 in the Carina nebula.
