Tom Cruise fans, take heed! It’s your last chance to enjoy the adventures of Ethan Hunt on Netflix. More than 100 titles are joining the streaming service in August, but 40 are set to depart ― that number includes “Mission: Impossible,” “Mission: Impossible II” and “Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol.” Other notable movies on the way out next month include the Robert De Niro classics “Taxi Driver” and “GoodFellas,” and Leonardo DiCaprio hits “Titanic” and “The Departed.” If you’re a comedy fan, you might also be sad to learn you’ll no longer be able to stream “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,” “Grown Ups” or “A Very Harold & Kumar Christmas” at the end of August as well. As for shows, the three seasons of “Wheel of Fortune” currently on Netflix will be gone on August 24, and all five seasons of the former ABC Family sitcom “Young & Hungry” depart the day before.
