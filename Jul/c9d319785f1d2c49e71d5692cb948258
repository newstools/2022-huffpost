After two-plus pandemic years of empty movie theaters, “Top Gun: Maverick’ is proving that blockbusters are officially back. It’s only been out for a month, but it’s already one of the biggest movies of the year, grossing more than $400 million at the box office so far. In fact, the only movie that’s come out in these pandemic times that’s made more money is “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” But there are people who liked “Top Gun” and there are people who freaking loved it. You know who the latter are. They walk into a room humming the anthem from the original soundtrack. They’ve told you (more than once) that Tom Cruise doesn’t use a stunt double. If you were to pull up their Google search history, it would include terms like “how much is a F-18” and “Miles Teller workout.” Alas, we can’t all be Maverick. But you can still make the “Top Gun” fan in your life feel pretty fly. How? Head to Target and surprise them with one of these gifts. HuffPost receives a share from retailers on this page.
