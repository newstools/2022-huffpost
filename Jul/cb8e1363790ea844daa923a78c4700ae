We’re a little over 12 hours into Prime Day, and visions of savings are dancing in our heads like so many sugarplums in July. So far, we’ve reviewed hundreds of pages on Amazon to isolate the very best deals on vacuum cleaners, coffee-making appliances, inflatable hot tubs and, of course, bidets. And as we while away the hours surfacing the savings that our readers might want to take advantage of, we thought you might be getting curious about what we, the HuffPost Shopping editors, are actually buying for ourselves. While our team of product enthusiasts have widely varied lifestyles, we have one thing in common: We know a good deal when we see one. And this year, we’ve seen a lot. The goods that have actually landed in our carts contain some things that you’ll immediately want to buy in bulk (a top-rated micellar water) and others that you didn’t think you needed, like a chili-crisp topping concocted by a Michelin-starred chef. Ahead, take a look at the stuff that’s actually getting us to smash the checkout button, FYI: Deals move quickly on Prime Day. We’ll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can’t catch everything immediately. Check back throughout Prime Day to see our latest updates as the deals change.
