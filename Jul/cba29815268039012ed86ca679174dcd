After wearing masks for nearly two years straight, we think our teeth deserve a little extra attention. One way to enhance your dental-hygiene routine is to incorporate a water flosser — specifically the Waterpik, which has a seal of approval from the American Dental Association. And you’re in luck because it’s currently on sale for Amazon Prime Day for $44.99 (regularly $99.99). This water flosser has over 74,000 five-star ratings on Amazon and for good reason. It uses a pulse-modulation technology for maximum plaque removal and has a hydro-pulse massage mode to help stimulate your gums and improve circulation. The 360-degree rotating tip also ensures that the pressurized water reaches all surfaces of your teeth so no spot goes uncleaned. FYI — deals move quickly on Prime Day. We’ll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can’t catch everything immediately. Check back throughout Prime Day to see our latest updates as the deals change!
