There’s nothing that improves the your music-listening experience like an external speaker — and luckily, there are a host of top-rated boom-worthy boxes on sale in the waning hours of Amazon Prime Day. Let’s face it: Head-banging to “I Love It” by Icona Pop on an audio-optimized Bluetooth speaker is much better than playing it from an iPhone sitting inside a metal bowl, and nothing ruins a viewing of “Mad Max: Fury Road” than having to listen to it through the tinny output embedded in your TV. Upgrade your sonic experience with one of these highly-rated soundbars, analog hi-fi speakers, or portable Bluetooth models. Your ears will thank you. FYI: Deals move quickly on Prime Day. We’ll do our best to keep this post and imagery tas up-to-date as possible, but we can’t catch everything immediately. Check back throughout Prime Day to see our latest updates as the deals change.
