While Amazon’s Prime Day sale technically starts Tuesday, July 12, many other stores and brands are offering their own special sales to compete — and of course, we’ve got our eye on Target. Starting today (beating Amazon by one single day) is Target’s Deal Days event, which goes through July 13. This is your chance to get huge discounts across every category, including beauty, kitchen appliances, clothing, electronics and more. From AirPod Pros getting a heavy discount at $175 to a small space-friendly Keurig coffee maker at $60, Target has you covered on stocking your home with must-have items. Below, we rounded up some of the best deals from Target’s Deal Days – but you can browse the full spread of deals here.
