A mall in Wilmington, Delaware, has left a “whopper” of an impression online this week. A vintage Burger King fast-food restaurant at the Concord Mall has gone viral following a tweet about the nostalgic spot this week, WPVI-TV in Philadelphia reported. The Burger King, on the mall’s first floor, is behind a wall with a locked door ― a sight that struck mall vendor Jonathon Pruitt when he shared it online earlier this year. The photo resurfaced this week and highlighted the restaurant’s old-school interior, especially its tables and floor. “It’s kind of cool. When I first saw it, I was blown away myself,” said Tom Dahlke, Concord Mall’s general manager. A Twitter user, in response to the viral tweet, replied with a video inside the abandoned restaurant and described it as a “back room” from when she worked a seasonal job in 2019. The restaurant opened at the mall in 1987 and originally appeared among stores such as Jefferson Ward, F.W. Woolworth 5 & 10, and Strawbridge & Clothier, according to The News Journal. It ended up behind a wall after the restaurant closed in 2009. The mall’s current owner, Namdar Realty Group, purchased the property in 2020, and the general manager “didn’t think much of” the Burger King, the newspaper said. Now that the tweet about the Burger King has sparked new attention, Dahlke said the mall is hoping to get the site filled again.
