There is something endlessly satisfying about setting up a chair by the ocean, pool or lake, and diving headfirst into a great book. Whether your genre of preference is romance, thrillers or something else entirely, the whole point of a “beach read” is that it’s a book that you can get completely lost in. Any criteria beyond that is, frankly, just made up. A beach read can (and should) be anything you want it to be. The only important factor for a good beach read is that, for a few moments, the story brings you entirely out of your own world and into someone else’s. It’s incredibly relaxing, and a great way to unwind after a busy workday or stressful life event. Here are nine books you can get at Target right now that would make great beach reads.
