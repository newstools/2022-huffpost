You know what makes happy hour happier? Bellying up to the bar with rapper Drake and knocking back shots with him ― on his dime. (Watch the video below.) Such was the lucky fate of Brittney Keara, who filmed the footage at a seafood restaurant in Detroit and spilled the details to TMZ last week. The “Certified Lover Boy” artist at first turned down the drink offer from Keara and her friend, explaining he had to catch a flight, she said. He then returned for a few shots ― tequila for him ― and seemed to be having fun as he toasted with the women. But he didn’t seem over the moon about Detroit when Keara asked if he was enjoying the city. The three reportedly made small talk and the four-time Grammy winner upgraded Keara’s whiskey order and covered the whole tab. “Appreciate you,” Keara says. “Welcome to the D!” Last month, the rapper went viral for a reason closer to home. He playfully grilled his son Adonis about where he got his basketball shooting skills after the 4-year-old apparently made 4 of 5 attempts.
