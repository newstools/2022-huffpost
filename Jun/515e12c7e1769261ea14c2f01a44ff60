The Sussexes are back in town. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry made their first official public appearance at Queen Elizabeth’s Platinum Jubilee on Friday. The couple joined other members of the royal family, including Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall; Prince William and Kate Middleton; Prince Edward; and Princess Anne, at London’s St. Paul’s Cathedral for a Service of Thanksgiving in honor of the queen’s 70 years on the throne. Harry and Meghan attended Thursday’s Trooping the Colour, the official celebration of the British monarch’s birthday, though they did not appear with other members of the royal family on the Buckingham Palace balcony, as they are no longer working royals. The service marked the Sussexes’ first public appearance alongside the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge since March 2020, when both couples attended a Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey. Meghan and Harry officially stepped back as working royals that month and moved to California, where they now reside. On Friday, the royal couples did not sit on the same side of the church, and were not seen together before or after the service. Buckingham Palace announced on Thursday night that Queen Elizabeth herself would not attend Friday’s service because of health concerns. “Taking into account the journey and activity required to participate ... Her Majesty with great reluctance has concluded that she will not attend,” the palace said in a statement. The 96-year-old monarch experienced “some discomfort” during Thursday’s events, the palace added. The queen’s disgraced son, Prince Andrew, also bowed out of the service after he tested positive for COVID-19. A source close to the duke told HuffPost on Thursday that Andrew was “naturally disappointed and saddened that he will not be able to join other royal family members” at the service.
