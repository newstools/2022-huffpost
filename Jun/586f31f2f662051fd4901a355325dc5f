“Jimmy Kimmel Live” guest host Sean Hayes tore into former New York Mayor and Donald Trump henchman Rudy Giuliani over Tuesday’s Jan. 6 House select committee revelations. Giuliani, who led Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election and remain in power despite losing the presidential vote, apparently admitted he didn’t have any facts to back his outlandish claims of widespread voter fraud. Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers said at the committee hearing Tuesday that Giuliani had told him before the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol: “We’ve got lots of theories, we just don’t have the evidence.” Bowers said he and others who heard the candid comments “kind of laughed about it.” Hayes had a more explicit reaction. “So as long as we’re presenting theories without evidence, I have a theory about Rudy Giuliani that the reason he smokes cigars is because he’s trying to break his habit of chewing on dildos,” he offered, quickly adding: “I don’t have any evidence.” See more in his Tuesday night monologue as Kimmel is taking the summer off and letting Hayes and other guests take the mic:
