Black excellence took center stage at the 2022 BET Awards on Sunday night to celebrate achievements in music, culture and sports. Taraji P. Henson once again hosted the show at Los Angeles’ Microsoft Theater, where artists, including Lizzo, Lil Wayne, Chance the Rapper, Ella Mai, Roddy Ricch, Jack Harlow and Chloe Bailey performed. Doja Cat lead the nominations heading into the ceremony with six nods. She could very likely dominate the R&B and hip-hop categories with her chart-topping third studio album “Planet Her” expected to take home multiple prizes. Her smash single “Kiss Me More” with SZA, which garnered the singer her first Grammy award earlier this year, is also up for Video of the Year and Best Collaboration. Ari Lennox and Drake tied as the second most-nominated artists with each picking up four nods. The rapper faced off against Doja Cat in the Album of the Year category, which also includes Kanye West, Silk Sonic, Tyler, The Creator, H.E.R. and reigning winner Jazmine Sullivan. But the night’s highest honor went to Sean “Diddy” Combs, who received the lifetime achievement award at the show, following last year’s winner Queen Latifah. The prestigious award is granted each year to industry giants who have “significantly shaped culture through their extensive careers” and “been transformative leaders that consistently inspire generations by setting a true standard of excellence.” The hip-hop mogul and entrepreneur certainly fits the bill, selling more than 100 million records worldwide over his career and founding the legendary Bad Boy Records. Combs also took the stage for a star-studded retrospective at the ceremony, which will feature Mary J. Blige, Jodeci, Nas, Lil’ Kim, Busta Rhymes, The Lox, Bryson Tiller, Faith Evans and The Maverick City Choir. Check out the nominees and winners below.
