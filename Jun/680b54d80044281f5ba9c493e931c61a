The Oval Office will never be the same. (Watch the video below.) James Corden visited President Joe Biden at work in a preview Monday of a longer segment to come. “The Late Late Show” host made an auspicious entrance by delivering an edible arrangement to the commander in chief. “This is both a snack and a gift,” he told the president, who didn’t seem thrilled. Corden then tried to add a few of his own touches to the place, covering a bust of Harry Truman with a photo of him and Harry Styles. Biden, playfully summoning a curmudgeonly side, appeared to veto the idea. “You’re covering up Harry Truman,” he groused. “Well, cover one Harry with another Harry,” Corden replied. “That’s what I’m saying. I just think it brightens the place up, ya know.”
