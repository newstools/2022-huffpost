Although the MTV Movie & TV Awards could easily be written off as “That Time Rachel McAdams And Ryan Gosling Made Out On Stage In An Extremely Sexy Way” — one truly never knows what could happen at Hollywood’s biggest night for scoring highly coveted golden popcorn paperweights awards. For instance, it’s the awards show in which Scarlett Johansson and Sandra Bullock also made out on stage; Sacha Baron Cohen fell on Eminem’s face and stuck his butt in his face during a very silly stunt; Reese Witherspoon trash talked Kim Kardashian during an acceptance speech; and Aubrey Plaza tried to pull a Kanye West on Will Farrell (and got kicked out). Point is, the MTV Movie & TV Awards are not the Oscars, Emmys or even the Golden Globes. The stakes are low, so any kind of chaos could easily ignite. The awards event is also only available on MTV, the network’s app or through streamers like Paramount+ and Hulu Live, so we know y’all aren’t watching it. But here at HuffPost, we are! And we will update you with all the winners and any kind of forementioned chaos. We promise. Big names like Zendaya, Jennifer Lopez, Timothée Chalamet, Tom Holland, Robert Pattinson, Lady Gaga and Oscar Isaac are all nominated for awards. We’re not sure if any of their PR reps will force them to show up, but we’ll definitely let you know if any win in their categories — which you can check out below. Plus, Vanessa Hudgens is hosting, and she did give us some stellar style at the 2022 Met Gala. And proving that she is the undisputed queen of wearing very flow-y fabric on the red carpet, she’s shown up to the MTV Movie & TV awards rocking this ensemble: Here’s just hoping Zendaya and Tom Holland pull a Rachel and Ryan.
