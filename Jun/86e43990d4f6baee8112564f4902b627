Whether you’re playing pop, country, ’90s R&B or the “Encanto″ soundtrack as you lounge poolside this summer, a portable, waterproof wireless Bluetooth speaker will help you keep the party going. From compact models that clip onto your chair or bag to palm-sized boomboxes that hold a charge for 24 hours, the speakers below are versatile, user-friendly and built for all sorts of beach and pool people. All of these listening devices are completely waterproof; some even float. That means you can splish and splash around them, take them in the shower or even drop them in the pool by mistake, only worrying about what song to play next. We’ve listed the play time for each speaker, as well as all their respective perks. Some have lights that change with the music, some connect to Wi-Fi and have voice control and some connect to other speakers, giving you double the sound.
