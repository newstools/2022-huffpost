Chris Evans appeared on “Jimmy Kimmel Live” Friday and tried to clarify an old tweet that got memed to infinity and beyond. The Boston-born actor was promoting the upcoming Pixar movie “Lightyear,” in which he voices Buzz Lightyear ― a character many viewers likely remember from the “Toy Story” series. Well, sort of. “There’s some confusion about this movie, partially fueled by you,” Kimmel said, before bringing out images of two of Evans’ tweets from 2020. The Marvel star had retweeted a trailer for “Lightyear” with the comment, “I don’t even have the words.” He actually did have a few more words, though, and followed up with a second tweet that said: “And just to be clear, this isn’t Buzz Lightyear the toy. This is the origin story of the human Buzz Lightyear that the toy is based on.” At the time, Evans’ tweet led to some head-scratching and a lot of jokes. “All right, well, OK,” Evans stammered, laughing, when Kimmel confronted him with the old posts. “Now, just ― OK, you know, it’s a shame. I proofread that like five times!” He then added some more context, saying the new film was envisioned as the in-universe movie that Andy and friends in “Toy Story” watched that got them interested in Buzz Lightyear toys. Watch his explanation above, with the exchange about his tweet starting at 3:17.
