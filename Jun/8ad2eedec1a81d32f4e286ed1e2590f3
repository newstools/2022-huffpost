A woman said that she received an indecent exposure citation at a music festival in Winnfield, Louisiana, earlier this month for wearing a crop top and shorts, the Shreveport Times reported. Casey LaCaze-Lachney showed off the alleged outfit, a black crop top and denim shorts, in a TikTok video to her followers. In response, the Winnfield Police Department skirted around mentioning LaCaze-Lachney and referred to an “unnamed citizen” who went on social media “blasting police officers.” “However, 3 female officers responded to various complaints about the person’s attire and the person of interest was issued a citation under the city ordinance,” the department stated. Fines for the first offense of indecent exposure carry an up to $300 with the department, the post explained. The department vowed to not get into a “social media war with anyone.” “We also cannot comment on details of any case under investigation or pending court action,” the department said. More of LaCaze-Lachney’s videos about her outfit can be viewed on her TikTok page.
