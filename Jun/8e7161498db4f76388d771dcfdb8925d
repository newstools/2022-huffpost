We’ve got bad news for Liz Lemon fans with a Netflix subscription. More than 100 titles are joining the streaming platform in July, but 26 are set to depart. That number includes all seven seasons of “30 Rock,” which will be gone at the end of the month. Other shows on the way out are “Chicago Med” (out July 21) and “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine” (gone July 1). Several popular films are also getting the boot next month, including Academy Award winners “The Social Network,” “Forrest Gump,” and “Django Unchained.” The same goes for horror movies like “Annabelle: Creation,” “Friday the 13th,” “The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia,” and “Texas Chainsaw 3D.” As for lighter fare, rom-com fans might want to stream “You’ve Got Mail,” “Home Again” and “Love Actually” before they’re no longer available on Netflix at the end of July.
