Prince Louis was the breakthrough hit at his great-grandmother’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations, and his parents are embracing it. The little royal captivated onlookers as he unabashedly acted his age, rotating between excited and cuddly, cheeky, bored and just plain over it during the festivities to celebrate Queen Elizabeth’s 70 years on the throne. “What a fantastic weekend of celebrations,” Prince William and Kate Middleton wrote on their official Twitter account Monday. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge thanked all those who participated in the festivities across London and the U.K. “We all had an incredible time, especially Louis… ” they added. Prince Louis watched parts of the jubilee with his two siblings, Princess Charlotte and Prince George; his parents; his grandfather Prince Charles and Charles’ wife, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall. They all joined the 96-year-old queen for an appearance from her balcony Sunday. Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and their two children, Archie and Lilibet, were also in London to celebrate the milestone, but only appeared sporadically.
