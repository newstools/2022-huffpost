Bill Nye is celebrating his first month as a married man. The host of the long-running “Bill Nye the Science Guy” TV series tied the knot with journalist and author Liza Mundy in May, People confirmed Wednesday. The ceremony took place in the Enid A. Haupt Garden of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., and was officiated by “Star Trek: Voyager” actor Robert Picardo. Photos of the nuptials were taken by former White House photographer Pete Souza. The couple wrote their own vows, which one attendee described as “equal parts moving and comical.” Mundy, a former Washington Post reporter, mentioned Nye’s mother, cryptanalyst Jacqueline Jenkins-Nye, in her 2017 book, “Code Girls: The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II.” Nye emailed Mundy following the release of the book, and the two began dating shortly afterward. The pair have kept their relationship mostly private. Last week, they attended the premiere of Nye’s new Peacock series, “The End Is Nye,” at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York. And in March, Mundy was by Nye’s side at the Captain Planet Foundation’s 30th anniversary gala, a nonprofit organization in Atlanta. “The End Is Nye” due out Aug. 25, will feature Nye as he explores “the most epic global disasters imaginable ― both natural and unnatural ― and then demystifies them using science to show how we can survive, mitigate, and even prevent them,” according to press notes. The six-episode series will include guest appearances by Seth MacFarlane, who is also an executive producer.
