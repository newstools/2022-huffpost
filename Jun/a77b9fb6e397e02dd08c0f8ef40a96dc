The retailer’s annual bonzana of deals is packaged with a good deal of hype, but if you keep your cool and follow our coverage, you can enjoy some actually-good savings on everything from high-ticket splurges to everyday skin care products that you’d be buying up in bulk anyway. As always, there will be plenty of markdowns that are only available for Amazon Prime members — and if you’re already part of this elite club of Amazon power users, we have a hot tip for you: There are more than a handful of early-access Prime Day deals live right now, which will be evolving as the week goes on and the two-day event gets closer and closer. Because we’ll be monitoring Amazon every day between now and July 12, we’ve rounded up some of the best early-access Prime Day deals ahead (in addition to some irresistible deals that are available to all Amazon shoppers).
