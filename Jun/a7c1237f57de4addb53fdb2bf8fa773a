Jannick Holste rhapsodized about judge Heidi Klum and dancing in his pre-audition chat on “America’s Got Talent.” (Watch the video below.)

Simon Cowell flashed a few of his signature smirks during the performance, but ultimately gave it a Simon-esque thumbs-up. “Fantastically good and fantastically bad at the same time,” he said. “Horrendous, but it kinda worked.” Find out Holste’s fate right here:
