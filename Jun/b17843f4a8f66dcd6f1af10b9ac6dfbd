The Pulitzer Prize-winning musical “A Strange Loop” is set to run circles around the competition at the 75th Tony Awards, which marks the first ceremony celebrating shows that opened after the COVID-19 shutdown. Returning to Radio City Music Hall in New York City on Sunday night after last year’s heavily delayed ceremony, Broadway’s biggest night is officially back in full force. The four-hour broadcast will air live coast-to-coast across Paramount+ and CBS with “West Side Story” star and newly minted Oscar winner Ariana DeBose at the helm as host. Playwright Michael R. Jackson’s autobiographical meta musical, which follows a Black queer composer writing a show about a Black queer composer, leads the pack with 11 nominations and is heavily expected to cinch the prize for Best New Musical. Casts from the five other musicals nominated in the category ― “Girl from the North Country,” “MJ,” “Mr. Saturday Night,” “Paradise Square” and “Six” ― are also set to perform at the ceremony, in addition to stars from the Patti Lupone-led “Company” and “The Music Man” featuring Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster, which are both up for Best Revival of a Musical. The original cast of “Spring Awakening” is also set to perform, following the release of their recent HBO documentary, as well as Bernadette Peters, Billy Porter and The New York City Gay Men’s Chorus. As for the plays, “The Lehman Trilogy” is the most nominated production with eight nods, while “for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is enuf,” “The Skin of Our Teeth,” “Clyde’s” and “Hangmen” are also up for major awards. The awards show will feature a special tribute to the legendary musical theater composer Stephen Sondheim, who died in November, as well as a lifetime achievement honor for five-time Tony winner Angela Lansbury.
