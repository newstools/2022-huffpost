VH1 has fired a reality star after video circulated online showing him beating a dog with a folding chair. The network booted Ceaser Emanuel, featured in “Black Ink Crew New York,” after a frightening clip reportedly shot on a doorbell camera showed him repeatedly kicking and hitting a dog. VH1 announced Thursday it had “made the decision to cut ties with Ceaser Emanuel” and said his departure won’t impact the upcoming season of the tattoo shop-based show. Walter Mosley, Emanuel’s lawyer, told People that the video making rounds was an old clip and that it showed the reality star stopping dogs from “attacking other animals.” Mosley described his client as a dog lover and owner of “many” pets. “This was an unfortunate situation as I understand it, where there were a number of other aggressive dogs attacking smaller dogs and probably was a lapse of judgment as to how to appropriately break it up, break up that interaction,” Mosley told People.
