Summer is here and that means it’s time to stock up on swimsuits, sunscreen and bug spray in preparation for the pool days you’ve dreamed about for months, because there’s nothing quite like spending a warm day lounging by the lake or channeling your inner Olympian by practicing your backstroke. But if you’re less of a professional swimmer and lean more toward drifting on top of the water, you need a pool float to match your relax-in-style vibes. Though you’ve likely seen kids splashing around the pool with numerous cartoon- and shark-themed floats, there are definitely full-sized options that adults can enjoy and use, too. These inflatables come in larger sizes and lengths, and in a variety of attention-grabbing shapes and styles (including one shaped like an actual slab of bacon) that will make you the star of everyone’s vacation Instagram posts this summer. Below, we rounded up 12 of the coolest pool floats for adults that will steal the show at every pool party you go to this year. Make sure you add an air pump to your cart before checking out.
