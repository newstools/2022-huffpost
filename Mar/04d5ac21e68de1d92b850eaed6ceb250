Harrowing footage shows the moment Sky News journalists came under fire from Russian forces in Ukraine earlier this week. Veteran Sky News foreign correspondent Stuart Ramsay and his team of four others were attacked Monday while driving in a vehicle near the capital of Kyiv. Video shows the moment the team’s car was fired upon. The attackers were Russian saboteurs targeting fleeing civilians, Ramsay reported. “It’s a professional ambush,” Ramsay says in narration over the video. “The bullets just don’t miss.” As the car takes fire, the journalists make a run for it down an embankment. Camera operator Richie Mockler, who continued to film even as bullets pierced the vehicle he was in, took two rounds to his body armor. All five journalists were able to make their escape and are back in the U.K. Russia has failed to capture Kyiv 10 days into its invasion of Ukraine, and unprecedented sanctions against Russia have continued to wreck the nation’s economy. Even so, thousands of Ukrainian civilians have reportedly been killed as Russian forces continue their push forward. “We were lucky,” Ramsay says in the video. “Thousands of Ukrainians are not. And every day, this war gets worse here.” Watch the video at Sky News.
