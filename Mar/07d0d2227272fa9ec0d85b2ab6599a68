Cinephiles, take note. It’s your last chance to stream a number of Academy Award-nominated films on Netflix. More than 100 titles are joining the streaming platform in April, but 23 are set to depart. That includes Oscar nominees like “The Shawshank Redemption,” “Moneyball,” “August: Osage County” and “The Florida Project,” as well as Best Picture winner “The Artist.” Other films on their way out next month include romantic movies like “About Time,” “Dear John” and “First Knight.” As for TV shows, we’ve got bad news for “Dawson’s Creek” fans. All six seasons are set to leave on April 30, so get your ’90s teen drama fix before then. And Trekkies may be sad to learn that all seven seasons of “Star Trek: The Next Generation” will be gone on April 1. Check out the full list of movies and shows leaving Netflix below.
