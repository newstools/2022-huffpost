This countertop oven and air fryer by Breville is one of the brand’s largest capacity models and could very well replace all of your other kitchen appliances — and it’s currently $150 off at Amazon for a limited time.  Accompanying the air fryer’s near 5,600 five-star ratings are reviews that claim this surprisingly compact appliance can cook virtually anything from cookies to a 14-pound turkey with faster cooking speeds and crispier results.  The 13 cooking functions offer everything from dehydration, baking, roasting, reheating, proofing, air frying and slow cooking while the interior light and window door allow you to keep an eye on your food as it cooks. Additionally, this oven comes with a pizza pan, two oven racks, a roasting pan and a fryer basket ideal for dehydrating food or crisping up fries.  This versatile appliance intelligently detects where heating power is needed to create evenly cooked food and an ideal cooking environment ― no more cold spots here. The oven uses super convection technology which means greater cooking precision, higher temperature capabilities, faster cooking times and crispy finished products on its air fry settings.
