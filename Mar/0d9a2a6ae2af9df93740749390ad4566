CNN’s senior international correspondent reacted calmly during a live report from Ukraine on Monday when he noticed he was crouching beside a grenade. Matthew Chance was at the site of a recent battle on the outskirts of Kyiv, speaking on air to a colleague in the U.S. when he stood up and retreated several steps. “I didn’t see that, so let’s move away from that,” he said, backing farther away before smoothly continuing his report about the Ukrainian resistance against Russian troops there earlier. Chance also showed viewers what he described as the “still smoking,” twisted metal wreckage from armored vehicles, debris and ammunition boxes from the Russian offensive. “There’s unexploded grenades ... like pineapple grenades everywhere,” he said. “A real scene of devastation.” He also pointed out the body of a Russian soldier. “I toured this area earlier and there were some terrible things that we can’t really show you on camera,” he said. “In terms of dead bodies. Russians.” Chance has been on the front lines in Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine early Thursday morning. Russian troops have met unexpectedly fierce resistance on the ground in multiple cities and towns, including Ukraine’s capital and its second-largest city, Kharkiv.
