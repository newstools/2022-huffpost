Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was admitted to the hospital on Friday night with flu-like symptoms, the court said in a statement Sunday night. “He underwent tests, was diagnosed with an infection, and is being treated with intravenous antibiotics,” the court’s office of public information said. “His symptoms are abating, he is resting comfortably, and he expects to be released from the hospital in a day or two.” Patricia McCabe, the court’s public information officer, told media outlets the virus was not COVID-19 or related to the coronavirus. Thomas, 73, was admitted to Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington D.C. The court is expected to hold oral arguments Monday through Wednesday this week. Thomas, the longest-serving member of the Supreme Court, will continue to participate in the consideration and discussion of any cases using briefs, transcripts and audio of oral arguments.
