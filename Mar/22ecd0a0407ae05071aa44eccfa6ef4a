A waxwork of Vladimir Putin was unceremoniously removed from the Grévin Museum in Paris following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A statue of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy may take its place alongside U.S. President Joe Biden, Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II and China’s Xi Jinping in the display of world leaders, museum officials told Agence France-Presse. “Current events mean we don’t want him here and the staff don’t want to walk past him every day,” museum director Yves Delhommeau said. “We have never represented dictators like Hitler in the Grévin Museum, we don’t want to represent Putin today,” Delhommeau added. The Grévin’s waxwork of Putin was created in 2000. It was attacked multiple times over the weekend, said Delhommeau. The statue will not be melted down and will be stored in a warehouse.
