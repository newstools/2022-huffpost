President Joe Biden on Thursday said he’d relish a 2024 rematch with his predecessor, Donald Trump. “I’d be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me,” Biden told reporters at an emergency summit with NATO leaders in Brussels to tackle Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden’s shade toward Trump followed a question about concerns in Europe that the coordinated response to the war could come undone if Trump wins back the White House. “One of the things that I take some solace from is I don’t think you’ll find any European leader who thinks that I am not up to the job,” Biden said. “The point is, the first G-7 meeting I attended like the one I did today was in Great Britain. And I sat down and I said, ‘America is back.’ And one of my counterparts, colleagues, as head of state, said, ‘For how long? For how long?’” Biden beat Trump by more than 7 million votes in the 2020 election, receiving 306 votes in the Electoral College compared to Trump’s 232. The twice-impeached Trump, however, continues to baselessly claim the election was rigged and that he was the true winner.
