Courteney Cox’s memory will not be there for you. The actor reminisced Sunday about her life-changing time on the 1994-2004 sitcom “Friends,” but admitted she forgot a lot. That became clear to her when she appeared on the reunion special last year. “I should’ve watched all 10 seasons because when I did the reunion and was asked questions, I was like, ‘I don’t remember being there,’” Cox told Willie Geist on NBC’s “Sunday Today.” “Yeah. I don’t remember filming so many episodes.” “I see it on TV sometimes and I stop and go, ‘Oh my God, I don’t remember this at all,’” she added. “But it’s so funny.” The actor did recall how “Friends” director James Burrows gave the not-yet-famous castmates $500 each for Las Vegas splurging money at the beginning. He told them it would be the last time they could walk through a casino together. “And it was true,” Cox said. But as for other moments, they’re hazy. Cox, who played the fastidious Monica, chalked up her inability to recollect to a “bad memory.” “It’s really basic,” she said. “I don’t remember any trauma in my childhood, but I have, like, three memories. I don’t know. I don’t know why.” The actor, who now stars in the Starz comedy horror series “Shining Veil” and appeared in a return to the “Scream” film franchise his year, regretted that she hadn’t taken more photos during her “Friends” years “because I don’t have a lot to look back at.” Watch portions of the interview here:
