“Dancing With The Stars” performer Maksim Chmerkovskiy detailed his “traumatizing” escape from Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion in a series of Instagram stories on Monday. The Ukrainian American dancer revealed he was on a packed, “sweaty and claustrophobic” train to Warsaw in Poland. “I’m a big man with nothing but a backpack it’s TRAUMATIZING,” wrote Chmerkovskiy, who was born in Odesa and immigrated to America in 1994. Chmerkovskiy said the moment that “finally broke” him was seeing a young boy “hysterically crying and not wanting to let go of his father.” The son told his father: “If you stay I want to stay too because if they kill you I won’t be able to help,” according to Chmerkovskiy, who was in Ukraine working on the reality series “World of Dance UA.” In later stories, he revealed he was at a train station some 30 minutes from the Polish border, waiting for the wheels on the locomotive to be adjusted for Poland’s rail network.
