March Madness is underway, but one of the tournament’s early games came to a halt until two cheerleaders saved the day. During a game between Indiana and St. Mary’s on Thursday, the ball became wedged behind the backboard and under the shot clock. Some of the players offered to climb a chair to retrieve it, but the ref said he didn’t want them to get hurt. And when he tried to grab the ball himself, he couldn’t reach it, either. Enter Indiana’s fearless cheerleaders. Nathan Paris hoisted Cassidy Cerny for the play of the game: “I was like, we lift them up all the time, so why don’t we try that?” Paris said as the two spoke to March Madness digital reporter Andy Katz: It was the brightest moment of the night for Indiana as the team fell to St. Mary’s in an 82-53 blowout.
