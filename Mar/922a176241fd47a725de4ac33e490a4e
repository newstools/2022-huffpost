First came the wide-eyed surprise from Katy Perry. Then came the knowing glances and smiles from fellow “American Idol” panelists Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie. Contestant Kenedi Anderson blew the talent show judges away with her rendition of Lady Gaga’s “Applause” in auditions that aired Sunday. (Watch the video below.) Perry joked (at least we think so) that she felt threatened by the 17-year-old from Virginia and asked for her autograph. “You’ve answered our prayers,” Richie gushed. But Bryan offered the most powerful praise of all. “I believe you might be the biggest star we’ve ever seen,” he said. For her performance, Anderson received a platinum ticket ― a new accolade for the show’s 20th platinum season — that will allow her to sit through one of the rounds of Hollywood Week to size up the competition and pick her duet partner.
