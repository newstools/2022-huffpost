Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, said she sends a damning message to Russian President Vladimir Putin every single day. Yovanovitch drinks her morning coffee from a mug emblazoned with the phrase “Fuck You Putin,” she told Insider in an interview published Thursday. “I’m here to tell you that your coffee in the morning tastes so much better in that mug,” she said. Yovanovitch said she orders the mugs in bulk to give out as gifts, as she does with the “Fuck You Putin” bracelet she wore during an appearance on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” earlier this month. “Everybody kind of looks at it and gasps and laughs,” she told Insider of the mugs. “I think they’re just surprised because I’m, you know, a pretty staid diplomat. They certainly wouldn’t expect me to give them a gift like that.” The former diplomat’s memoir, “Lessons From The Edge,” details her service in Ukraine, which ended in 2019 following a smear campaign from Donald Trump allies who feared she’d scupper their attempts at digging up dirt on now-President Joe Biden.
