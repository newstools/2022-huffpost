Commentators were baffled on Tuesday by the unfitting adjective former President Donald Trump selected to attack Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.).

But the former president was reportedly aggrieved by Brooks’ remarks at a rally last year encouraging attendees to move on from the 2020 election. More than 16 months after the vote, Trump still insists, falsely, that the vote was fraudulent. “There’s no one in Alabama with the brain size of a pea or larger who would believe that I’m a woke liberal,” Brooks told NBC News in response to Trump’s statement.

Brooks reportedly cheered the rioters as they did so. The congressman has quoted Hitler to attack opponents, accused Democrats of waging a “war on whites” and once said that Muslims want to kill every gay person in the country. Twitter users and media figures were stunned by Trump’s definition of “woke” these days:
