Halle Berry’s Storm-type hairstyle at the Critics Choice Awards generated speculation that she’s reprising her “X-Men” character soon. Berry further fueled the talk of her return as Storm with a tweet on Monday: “This is for all my beautiful fans that have wanted my short hair back! This is for YOU!” ComicBook.com noted that Marvel’s “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,” scheduled for release in May, has a trailer suggesting that Patrick Stewart’s Professor X from “X-Men” could appear. Naturally, folks are wondering if Berry showed off her short, streaked do as a sly hint that she’s in it, too. Berry told ComicBook.com that she was grateful to play characters from big franchises, “so I would revisit any of them.” The Oscar winner once gushed about the possibility of playing Storm again to Deadline. “I love that character through and through,” she said. “So if that ever became an opportunity for me if it’s before I’m 65 years old, I would absolutely do that.” For now, though, it’s just a rumor ― and a hope ― that the weather-manipulating superhero will be portrayed once again by Berry, as she has done multiple times.
