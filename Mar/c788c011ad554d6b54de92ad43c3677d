At a White House event on Monday to celebrate the final day of Black History Month, Jill Biden wore a cream-colored face mask featuring an embroidered sunflower design on the side. White House officials said the first lady’s mask choice was intended to demonstrate solidarity with the people of Ukraine amid the war that began Feb. 24. The sunflower is Ukraine’s national flower and has become a symbol of resistance to the Russian invasion after a clip was shared of a Ukrainian woman reportedly telling Russian soldiers to put sunflower seeds in their pockets so that when they died on Ukrainian land, sunflowers would grow. To show your support for the Ukrainian resistance no matter where you are, see below for a list of sunflower adorned masks similar to Jill Biden’s.
