Stars brought out all the glitz and glamour for the swankiest red carpet of the year: the 94th Academy Awards. The 2022 Oscars, held at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles on Sunday, kicked off with great fanfare as Laverne Cox, wearing a voluminous August Getty Atelier creation, interviewed attendees as they made their way into the show. Some attendees, including actors Jamie Lee Curtis and Youn Yuh-jung and songwriter Diane Warren, walked the carpet wearing blue ribbons in a show of support for Ukraine. Last year’s Oscars took place without a host. This time, though, the show will have not one but three hosts, as Amy Schumer, Regina Hall and Wanda Sykes take over (and likely take aim at the audience, though Sykes said the show won’t be “mean-spirited”). “We aren’t going to trash anyone,” Sykes told Deadline last week, insisting that the comedians will instead err on the side of satire ― though she said one host occasionally takes things to another level. “Regina, we got to hold her back sometimes,” Sykes said. “She goes for the jugular.” Schumer, meanwhile, said she’s looking to get into trouble with her first Oscars hosting gig. “Wanda, Regina are hilarious, and we’re having a blast preparing,” the “Life & Beth” star told Extra! earlier this month. “I mean, I don’t know who made the decision to let me personally be a host, but it’s not a good one ... because it’ll burn all bridges. I’ll burn every bridge.” See all the Oscars red carpet looks below:
