Paul Gosar’s (R-Ariz.) — participation as “appalling.” But at a GOP candidates’ debate, Vance said Greene “is my friend and she did nothing wrong.” “I’m not going to throw her under the bus,” he added. Vance also complained that while Republicans were subjected to “guilt by association” attacks, Democrats were not.
