Shortly after her arrest, a prerecorded video circulated online of Ovsyannikova explaining why she chose to speak out, blaming Russian President Vladimir Putin for the “fratricidal” war against Ukraine, and apologizing to viewers for her past work at the station. “Unfortunately, I’ve spent many of the last few years working for Channel One, doing Kremlin propaganda, and I’m deeply ashamed of this,” she said, according to a translation. “Ashamed that I allowed lies to come from the TV screen. Ashamed that I allowed the zombification of the Russian people.” “We Russians are thinking and intelligent people,” she added. “It’s in our power alone to stop all this madness. Go protest.
