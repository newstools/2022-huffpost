Jeff Foxworthy certainly did not win over any millennials with a new yet very old joke. The comedian, best known for his “you might be a redneck” shtick from the 1990s, quipped about participation trophies in his new Netflix special called “The Good Old Days.” Foxworthy, whose 1958 birth date makes him a baby boomer (though he may identify as a late baby boomer or Generation Jones), made plenty of observational jokes about older and younger generations throughout his special.
