Ezra Miller, who plays the Flash in an upcoming movie about the superhero, was arrested early Monday after a rowdy visit to a bar in Hilo, Hawaii, police said. Miller, 29, “became agitated” and started yelling obscenities at patrons singing karaoke, police said in a Facebook post. The actor, who also appeared as the Flash in 2016’s “Batman v Superman” and 2017’s “Justice League,” then grabbed the microphone from a 23-year-old woman who was performing. Miller “later lunged at a 32-year-old man playing darts,” police added. The bar owner told officers he could not calm the unruly customer, despite repeated attempts. Miller, who police said was visiting from Vermont, was charged with disorderly conduct and harassment. They were released after posting $500 bail. In 2020, Miller reportedly was escorted out of a bar in Iceland after an altercation with a woman. Miller’s arrest in Hawaii occurred just weeks before the U.S. release of “Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,” in which the performer reprises the role of Credence Barebone. “The Flash,” meanwhile, is scheduled for a 2023 release. HuffPost did not immediately hear back from Miller’s talent agency.
