“Saturday Night Live” star Kate McKinnon pretended this weekend that the hugely controversial “Don’t Say Gay” bill passed by Florida’s House of Representatives might actually be a good thing. “I heard about this law, and I think it’s amazing,” McKinnon, who is herself gay, told “Weekend Update” co-anchor Colin Jost. “When I was in middle school, in the ’90s, I was kind of tortured by the constant use of the word ‘gay,’” she explained. “Like, you know, ‘That’s so gay,’ or ‘Ew, you’re gay.’ It made me feel horrible.” Now, McKinnon said, she’s “so jazzed” to hear that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) “has taken a stand, and said, ‘No, you cannot say gay in school anymore’ ... and in Florida of all places!” But Jost explained that the bill — which would outlaw school instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade — is not what McKinnon imagined. And she’s struck speechless... for a bit, anyway. Then it was time to say “gay” ― a lot. “I am deeply gay,” McKinnon said. “Sorry, concerned. Deeply concerned. It just feels like this is going to make kids gay and trans ― sorry, depressed and suicidal.” “If the ’90s were right, and ‘gay’ means ‘bad,’ then this is the gayest law I have ever seen,” McKinnon concluded, before leading the audience in a chant of “gay, gay, gay” to the tune of Deep Purple’s “Smoke on the Water.” Check out the clip above.
