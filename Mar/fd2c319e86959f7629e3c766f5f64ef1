Twitter accounts run by the Russian government are amplifying Lara Logan’s latest controversial comments. Logan in November was sidelined from her show on Fox News’ streaming platform Fox Nation after likening the nation’s top infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci to infamous Nazi war criminal Josef Mengele. Last week, she questioned reports that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has been a disaster for Russian President Vladimir Putin, appeared to suggest Ukraine’s entire military had been taken over by Nazis, said Russia was “not struggling” with its war and tried to link Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy previous career in the entertainment industry to the occult. “I don’t buy it for a second, and I’ll be honest with you. I really think that there’s so much misinformation,” she told the Real America’s Voice platform of Russia’s war on Ukraine. “We’ve never really seen anything like it. I mean, I’ve been covering wars now for 35 years and I have never seen people with their nails done in the Ukrainian flag. Right?” the former “60 Minutes” correspondent continued. “I mean, we’re being corralled into this box where we either have to hate Vladimir Putin and believe everything evil that’s said about him, and love Ukraine, and there’s no in-between.” “And that reminds me a lot of you’re either, you know, a white supremacist or you go with the Democrat narrative on everything under the sun,” she added.
