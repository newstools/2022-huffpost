Popular Items From This List A cozy travel blanket if you’re tired of shivering through flights. This is no wimpy shawl, but rather a nearly six-foot medium weight blanket with an included carrier handle you can use to mount on your carry-on.    A Trtl neck pillow that’ll actually support your neck while you try to catch some mid-flight Zs. It’s way less bulky than traditional travel pillows and will keep you from head bobbing onto your neighbor’s shoulder.    A lightweight water-resistant backpack that makes the perfect airline personal item with plenty of space for a laptop, chargers, a change of clothes, and more, plus cushy, airflow back panels to fight against the dreaded back sweat as you run to catch your flight (we’ve all been there).
