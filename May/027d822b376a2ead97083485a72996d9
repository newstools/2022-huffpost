DENVER (AP) — AT&T Sportsnet reporter Kelsey Wingert says she’s recovering after being struck in the head by a line drive during the ninth inning of the Colorado Rockies’ game against the San Francisco Giants earlier this week. “I took a 95 MPH line drive to my head,” Wingert said in a tweet, along with a photo that showed a row of stitches on her forehead. Wingert, who covers the Rockies, was in the camera well past the Rockies’ first-base dugout on Monday night. Giants outfielder Austin Slater fouled a ball off Rockies reliever Daniel Bard and the ball hit Wingert. Wingert said she spent five hours in a hospital, where tests revealed no fractures or internal bleeding. She said she “received internal & external stitches.” Wingert also was hit by a foul ball in 2018, when she was covering the Atlanta Braves for Fox Sports South. She suffered a broken right eye socket when she was struck by a foul ball from Odubel Herrera of the Philadelphia Phillies. ___ More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports
