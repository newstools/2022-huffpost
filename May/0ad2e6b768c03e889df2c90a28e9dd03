Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker have apparently had their second of at least three weddings. The reality TV star and Blink-182 drummer were legally married at the Santa Barbara courthouse in California on Sunday, sources told TMZ and People. They also were pictured driving away in a convertible with a “Just Married” sign strapped to it. Kardashian was wearing a simple white dress and shawl, and Barker wore a black suit. The pair were legally wed in front of a few close friends and family members, a source told People. They have a big wedding planned in Italy very soon, the source said. That’ll be the third marital affair. The first, a “practice” run, was in Las Vegas last month. The two got hitched at the One Love Wedding Chapel in the early hours “after an epic night and a little tequila,” though Kardashian clarified that there was no marriage license. “Practice makes perfect,” she wrote alongside some images of the event. A source told TMZ at the time that the couple planned “several more” weddings. The couple, who have become known for their unbridled displays of public affection, have been dating for a little over a year. They got engaged in October after a lavish beach proposal complete with gigantic floral arrangement. It’s the reality star’s first marriage. She shares three children with her ex-boyfriend, TV personality Scott Disick. Barker has previously been married twice.
