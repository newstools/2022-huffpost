The 2022 Met Gala’s “gilded glamour” theme is one that should be all too familiar to “Bridgerton” stars. Nicola Coughlan, best known for playing Penelope Featherington on the hit Netflix series, channeled her character with a regal pink-and-black dress with puff sleeves and, most appropriately, *feathers.* Meanwhile, Simone Ashley, who starred as Kate Sharma in Season 2 of the period series, wowed in a corset and skirt with statement sleeves. Fans were disappointed, however, when the diamond of Season 1 failed to produce the splendor they’re used to seeing on her in the Regency-era drama. Phoebe Dynevor, aka Daphne Bridgerton, left some onlookers underwhelmed in a relatively muted black dress. From dramatic puff sleeves to corsets, ruffles, lace floral prints and opulent jewelry, Shonda Rhimes’ adaptation of Julia Quinn’s novels has been filled with fashion statements. Fans expected that to align with the theme of 2022′s Met Gala, which asked attendees to “embody the grandeur — and perhaps the dichotomy — of Gilded Age New York.” The one “Bridgerton” character who really would have met the brief, sadly, did not make an appearance.
