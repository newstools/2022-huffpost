In what many critics deemed a spectacular self-own, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced in a Tweet that he welcomed a global recession so money would stop “raining” down on “fools.” Musk posted the comment Thursday in response to a question concerning his attitude about a possible coming recession. As for raining money, critics were happy to point out that Musk has been the recipient of millions of dollars in tax breaks ($64 million from Texas alone), and a very hefty government loan, among other support. Tesla scooped up a $465 million loan in 2009 as part of a federal stimulus package, which financed the development and manufacture of Tesla’s groundbreaking Model S. In 2015, the Los Angles Times estimated that Musk’s companies had already benefited from some $5 billion in government support. In an added dig, the self-awareness-challenged Musk accused people who have been stuck working remotely because of the pandemic of now being under the delusion that they “don’t actually need to word hard.” He chuckled: “Rude awakening inbound!” Musk figured in his tweet that a good recession would last up to 18 months so “negative cash flow” resource-gobbling enterprises can “die” — apparently forgetting that it took Tesla nine years to post its first annual profit. Twitter critics had a “rude awakening” (inbound!) for Musk.
