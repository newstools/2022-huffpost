The new “Thor: Love And Thunder” trailer is here and it offers fans an eyeful of Chris Hemsworth’s god bod. While last month’s teaser featured Thor’s ex-girlfriend Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) wielding the mighty hammer Mjolnir, this one gives fans a look at Christian Bale’s Gorr the God Butcher as well as Russell Crowe as Zeus. A single flick from Zeus leads to one heavily blurred butt. “You flicked too hard, dammit!” Thor cries as he stands in all his glory: “Thor: Love And Thunder,” the fourth Thor-centered movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, hits theaters on July 8.
