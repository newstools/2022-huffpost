“The Late Show” announced Monday it had paused production after host Stephen Colbert experienced “symptoms consistent with a recurrence of COVID,” just days after he returned to the air with what he felt was “a serious head cold.” “Out of an abundance of caution for his staff, guests, and audience, he will be isolating for a few additional days,” the CBS show posted on Twitter, adding it would “not be taping new episodes until further notice.” Colbert shared the announcement, calling it the “WORST. SEQUEL. EVER.” The late night host first announced his coronavirus diagnosis on April 21. “Yep! I tested positive for Covid, but basically I’m feeling fine — grateful to be vaxxed and boosted,” he wrote on Twitter. Colbert returned to the air on May 2. He told his audience that the first three days of illness “sucked,” he tested negative six days into his isolation, and “on day 12 I’m back with a serious head cold.” Watch the video here: On Friday, Colbert’s Grammy Award-winning bandleader Jon Batiste announced on Instagram that he’d tested positive for COVID and would postpone his long-awaited “American Symphony” show at Carnegie Hall in New York. Batiste attended the Met Gala last week. His wife, the author Suleika Jaouad, is currently receiving chemotherapy treatment for cancer.
