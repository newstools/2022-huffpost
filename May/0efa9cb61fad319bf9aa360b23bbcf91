“Ozark” is the most popular show on Netflix, according to the streaming service’s public ranking system. In this crime drama, Jason Bateman and Laura Linney play Marty and Wendy Byrde, a married couple who move their family from Chicago to Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri in order to carry out a money-laundering scheme for a Mexican drug cartel. The fourth and final season was released in two parts, with the second half premiering on April 29. Unfortunately for fans, the latest seven episodes mark the end of the critically acclaimed series. The second most popular show on Netflix is “Welcome to Eden,” a Spanish thriller series that debuted on May 6.
