If there’s one place on the web turning even more hostile than Twitter, it’s Nextdoor ― and Jimmy Kimmel is there for the drama. “Nextdoor Theatre” features celebs reenacting arguments using actual transcripts from the hyperlocal website. The full segment debuts on Wednesday night’s “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” but HuffPost has an exclusive preview, above, featuring Lisa Kudrow, Donald Glover, Jason Segel and Michael Chiklis. Kimmel is out after testing positive for COVID-19 again, and guest hosts John Mulaney and Andy Samberg ― stars of the new “Chip ’n Dale: Rescue Rangers” reboot on Disney+ ― will fill in and launch the segment. Although Kimmel said on Twitter that he’s “feeling fine,” there’s no word yet on what his Nextdoor neighbors have to say about it.
