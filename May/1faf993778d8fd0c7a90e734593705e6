The second temps start rising, you can count on the smell of backyard grilling to waft through the air. It’s the scent spring and summer are made of. Steaks, burgers (and Beyond Burgers), chicken, fish, veggies, fruit…everything tastes better when it’s fresh off the grill and paired with a cool drink. Whether you plan on having some epic grilling sessions just for your fam or you plan on inviting friends over to join in on the fun, now is the time to get ready. You may have your grill (kinda need that), but your set-up shouldn’t end there. Just like how in the kitchen there are tools that make the cooking process easier and more efficient, there are grilling accessories that will seriously step up your game. Rounded up here is everything you need to be the ultimate griller, and you can get it all at Walmart. Not only do they make grilling easier, but they help cut down on clean-up time too. That way, you’ll spend more time doing what’s really important: eating and having fun. HuffPost receives a share from retailers on this page.
