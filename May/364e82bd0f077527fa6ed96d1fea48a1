What would Lady Whistledown make of it? Ruby Stokes is leaving the hit Netflix show “Bridgerton.” Her character Francesca Bridgerton, who appeared sporadically in the first two seasons, will be replaced in the upcoming third season of the regency period drama by Hannah Dodd, of “Anatomy of a Scandal” fame. Stokes is off to star in Netflix’s upcoming “Lockwood & Co.” series, reported Deadline. The recasting could mean the younger Bridgerton sibling has a more prominent role in future episodes, the outlet suggested. Filming on the third season begins this summer.
