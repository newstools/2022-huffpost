John Travolta went all-out to honor his late wife Kelly Preston on Mother’s Day, sharing a 4-minute, 30-second video packed with photos. (Watch it below.) Set to Barbra Streisand’s rendition of “That Face,” the montage of Travolta and Preston with their children — Ella, Benjamin and late son Jett — is heartbreaking.  Travolta and Preston were married for 28 years; Preston, who had breast cancer, died in July 2020. Last year, for the first Mother’s Day without Preston, the “Pulp Fiction” and “Saturday Night Fever” star posted a short and sweet tribute with two photos. But this year he flooded Instagram with sweet memories. He closes the video: “With all my love, Johnny.”
