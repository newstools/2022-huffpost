Hillary Clinton paid tribute to dozens of American women she admires in her first Met Gala appearance in more than 20 years. Clinton, a former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, embraced the “In America: An Anthology of Fashion” theme with a Joseph Altuzarra-designed dress embroidered with 60 names on the hem and neckline. The women honored included Harriet Tubman, Abigail Adams, Eleanor Roosevelt and Madeleine Albright. Clinton spoke at a memorial for Albright last week. “I would’ve filled the entire dress,” Clinton said on the red carpet of the event.
