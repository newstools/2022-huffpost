In the wake of Tuesday’s shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, there’s one phrase Whoopi Goldberg never wants to hear again: “thoughts and prayers.” Goldberg railed against the meaningless term on Wednesday’s episode of “The View,” threatening to do something drastic the next time a Republican senator like Ted Cruz utters those words in lieu of actually doing anything to prevent future mass shootings. “Why are we always at square one with this? And I swear to God, if I see another Republican senator talk about their heart being broken, I’m going to go punch somebody. I can’t take any thoughts and prayers,” Goldberg said. “If your thoughts and prayers were really with everybody, you’d have done something by now. It’s not like anybody’s not trying to make this happen. What the hell is going on?” Goldberg’s co-host Joy Behar also begged Republicans to “stop gaslighting” her regarding the cause of the shootings. “Stop saying ‘it’s not guns that kill people, it’s people that kill people.’ It’s guns that kill people, OK?” she said. “Stop saying the opposite. Stop saying that mental illness is behind this.” “There’s mental illness in every country in the world, and they don’t have this problem,” she went on. “So stop gaslighting me on that one, and stop saying that you can have a good guy stop a bad guy with a gun.” You can see the segment below.
