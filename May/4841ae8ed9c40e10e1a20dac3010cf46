The awkward moment Joe Rogan realized the issue he was passionately ranting about was actually fake news has gone viral on social media. On an episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast released on Spotify last week, host Rogan went off on (nonexistent) plans to ban people in Australia from growing their own food. The people behind the (debunked) proposals were “fucking creeps,” Rogan raged, suggesting it was an extension of COVID pandemic restrictions and a way to smoke out anti-vaxxers. Things quickly went awry for Rogan, though, when he couldn’t back up the story. Neither he nor his producer could find any details about the plans online. “It’s gotta be a, a real thing. It seems too good to not be,” admitted Rogan, whose popular show has been mired in coronavirus misinformation and racism scandals. He’s admitted he’s a “fucking moron” and “not a respected source of information, even for me.” “Dammit. It better not be fake. It might be fake,” he added. Watch the video here:
