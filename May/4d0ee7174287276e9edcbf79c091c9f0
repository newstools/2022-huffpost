When COVID-19 hit and restrictions supplied a steady stream of free time, I, like many people, discovered the therapeutic wonders of cooking. The only problem was, my kitchen has only one section of viable counter space and therefore a limited ability to support my 10-course meal aspirations.  I found myself getting creative by using elevated shelving units, multi-use prep surfaces and smaller kitchen appliances in order to sustain my new affinity for cooking without having to change my address.  Whether you struggle with the same small kitchen woes or just want a more neat and tidy cooking space, this list of space-conscious items can be incredibly useful. Find fan-favorite pans that do the work of eight pieces of traditional cookware, hidden storage units that slide into tight spaces, and cutting boards that fit securely over the sink to extend your counter space.
