A CNN crew got around a ban on media at a campaign event for Pennsylvania GOP gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano by renting a room at the Uniontown hotel where it was being held so they could film from a balcony. In a segment that aired Monday, CNN correspondent Kyung Lah said the rally for the state senator, a front-runner in this month’s Republican primary, had been advertised as open to all. But on arrival, organizers told them “journalists aren’t welcome.” With the permission of the hotel, Lah said she booked a room with a balcony that overlooked the poolside rally. Mastriano staffers “threatened to kick us out, saying they controlled all the space in the hotel,” she wrote on Twitter. “Not so. They were unhappy we stayed.” Mastriano, a proponent of Donald Trump’s election lies who frequently rails against abortion rights and COVID restrictions, is among a growing number of Republicans attempting to duck public scrutiny, reported CNN. “Why do this? Bc independent press needs to see what your future government reps want to do,” added Lah. Watch the full report here:
