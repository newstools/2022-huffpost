My go-to summer look involves an oversized T-shirt, biker shorts, a pair of sunnies and of course, my favorite walking shoes. As we transition into warmer weather, I’m slowly replacing my sweaters and sweatshirts with comfy graphic T-shirts. From tees with my favorite music artists to vintage-inspired shirts printed with retro brand logos and TV shows, there isn’t a graphic tee I’m going to skip on buying. These fun shirts are incredibly easy to create outfits with, and can go with jeans, shorts, skirts or whatever other bottoms you have in your closet. Depending on your height, some are even long enough to wear solo as shirt dresses. Consider them the universal “I don’t know what to wear” clothing item. Even though you can likely find them at your local thrift or vintage stores, you’ll have more cer luck finding more sizes, styles and price points online. To help you channel your low-effort summer outfit journey, we rounded up 8 stores below that sell a wide array of graphic tees online.
