Stephen Colbert spotted a moment in a new interview where Donald Trump admitted that there’s an insult he really doesn’t like.

Trump, however, crowed about passing. “It was an amazing thing,” he said, suggesting it forced his critics to admit to his intelligence. “They now call me a dictator and other things, but they don’t call you stupid.” Colbert was stunned into silence for about 8 seconds. “He thinks we don’t call him stupid?” he finally said, then dramatically turned to another camera for a closeup. “What a moron!” See more in his Thursday night monologue:
