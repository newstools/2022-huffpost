Twitter users have found their hero of the week. A resourceful Texas 2-year-old has been hailed as a “legend,” “icon” and “warrior” after secretly ordering himself 31 cheeseburgers with a food delivery app on his mom’s phone. Kelsey Golden shared the story about her son Barrett on social media last week, and obviously struck a chord, making it on news programs around the country. Golden told news outlets she thought Barrett was just playing with the camera on her locked phone, until a DoorDash driver arrived with a $91 order ― including a $16 tip to the delivery person. Barrett’s initiative clearly resonated with Twitter users, who expressed their awe after an article about his haul blew up on social media Monday. See some of the fun below:
