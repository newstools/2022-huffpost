Is it just me, or are the crotches of underwear getting skinnier and skinnier? Move just the wrong way, and all hell breaks loose from that narrow piece of fabric meant to separate your bits from the uncomfortable lining of your pants. Not only have medical professionals revealed that too-tight or ill-fitting underwear can lead to vaginal irritation, but the tiny-panty market also seems to bolster the unattainable “designer vagina” ideal by completely disregarding the variety of anatomy that naturally exists. Even Khloe Kardashian mentioned this in a recent episode of “Keeping Up With The Kardashians” when she pointed out the string-like design of the Skims bodysuit. Unsurprisingly, this sentiment is felt by many vagina-havers who have taken to the anonymous threads of Reddit to express their qualms with narrow-crotch underwear — and to share where to find options that will actually fit.  We used one helpful Reddit thread in particular to help create the following list of wide-gusset and vulva-inclusive underwear, which range from lacy thongs that offer a surprising amount of frontal coverage to supportive high-waisted briefs in a seam-free design and low-rise cheeky panties made with a barely-there mesh.
