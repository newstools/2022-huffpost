The Black Dahlia Murder metal band announced the death of lead singer Trevor Strnad on Wednesday. He was 41. “It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of Trevor Scott Strnad. Beloved son, brother, and Shepard of good times, he was loved by all that met him,” the group, founded by Strnad in Michigan in 2001, wrote on Instagram. Strnad was “a walking encyclopedia of all things music,” the band said in the post, praising him as “truly one of the world’s greatest entertainers.” “His lyrics provided the world with stories and spells and horror and whimsy. It was his life to be your show,” bandmates added. A cause of death was not revealed. The group left details for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at the end of its post. The group, whose name derived from the unsolved 1947 “Black Dahlia” murder of Elizabeth Short, released nine albums. Rockers and fans alike flooded social media with tributes to the singer: If you or someone you know needs help, call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
