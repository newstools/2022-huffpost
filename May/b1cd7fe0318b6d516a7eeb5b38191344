The shocking draft majority opinion that was leaked by Politico earlier this month revealed what many pro-choice advocates have feared: the Supreme Court is likely to overturn Roe v. Wade. To know what this could mean for abortion access and reproductive healthcare, one only has to read the Atwoodian accounts of illegal abortions conducted prior to 1973. If you’re a pro-choice supporter, protecting government-funded organizations like Planned Parenthood (which does so much more in the way of sexual health than abortions) is now more imperative than ever. Many brands and businesses have also recognized this need and are pledging to donate profits to various groups that help provide abortion access, resources and education.
