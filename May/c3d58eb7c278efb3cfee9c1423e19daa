“Late Night” host Seth Meyers took two different kinds of shots at former President George W. Bush on Thursday. Bush made a presidential-level mistake earlier this week when he slipped up and referenced a “wholly unjustified and brutal” invasion of Iraq. He later corrected himself, referencing the invasion of Ukraine, but the internet swiftly found a “Freudian slip” in his error. Meyers, who played the clip on his show, said Bush’s hiccup was proof of reality being a “simulation.” The host flashed a nervous look so he eased his stress with the help of some alcohol. “You know, when I started this show I poured exactly one shot of whiskey and left it in the drawer of my desk in case of emergency,” Meyers said. “And throughout the entirety of the Trump presidency, I resisted using it, but you know what? F―k it.” You can watch a clip of Meyers’ much-needed shot below.
