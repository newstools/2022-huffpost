Fox News’ Geraldo Rivera claimed he once a saw a UFO when he was driving in the Bahama Banks while “stoned on ecstasy.” The veteran conservative commentator’s revelation about driving under the influence came during a discussion about a House Intelligence Committee hearing on unidentified flying objects on Tuesday’s broadcast of “The Five.” “I’ve sailed around the world, I’ve seen a lot of clear skies. I’ve seen satellites, which are kind of spooky, weather balloons, stray aircraft,” Rivera told his fellow panelists. “The only time I ever saw a UFO, I was stoned on ecstasy,” he recalled. “It looked like a great big North Star, brighter than the North Star, it was right on the horizon then I tried to avoid it. I steered around it.” “You were driving on ecstasy?” interrupted stunned co-host Emily Compagno. “It kept following me and I went back the other way,” Rivera continued, ignoring the question. “It was right in front of me. It just tracked me everywhere I went.” Rivera’s description of the incident suggested he was driving a boat, though it was unclear. He didn’t say when it happened.
