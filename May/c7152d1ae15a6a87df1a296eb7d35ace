As if it weren’t hard enough to find the right shoe that’s comfortable, affordable and not an eyesore, the task is even harder if you wear a large men’s shoe size ― it’s likely that your size isn’t available at stores in-person, forcing you to scour the web to find shoes that will fit your feet. But that doesn’t mean you have to resort to ordering custom shoes or buying from low-key sketchy sites you’ve never heard of. Many popular brands and stores carry extended sizes for men’s shoes, ranging from 14 to 20, and in a variety of styles like sandals, slides, loafers and sneakers. Whether you’re in need of some vacation shoes for your next trip or your favorite pair of basketball shoes are in dire need of being replaced, you don’t have to worry about not being able to find some that actually fit. Below, we rounded up six online stores that have men’s shoes size 14 and up, including brands like Nike, New Balance, Skechers and Deer Stags.
