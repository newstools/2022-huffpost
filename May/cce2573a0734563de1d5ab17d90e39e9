“Saturday Night Live” took a break from politics in the cold open to get pooped out over the wild $50 million Amber Heard-Johnny Depp defamation trial. The cast got right to the “mess” Heard deliberately left in the bed she shared with Depp when the two weren’t getting along. Asked in court how he felt about finding “fecal matter” in his bed, “Depp,” played by a pony-tail-wearing Kyle Mooney, responded: “I felt very, very sad.” After an objection over a mangled line of questioning, Judge Penney Azcarate (played by a wine-drinking Cecily Strong channeling Judge Jeanine Pirro) rules: “I’ll allow it because it does sound fun, and this trial is for fun.” The results of the offending incident are revealed in court in a surveillance video of property manager Kenan Thompson as he’s checking out Heard and Depp’s bedroom. He sniffs: “Damn! Smells like boo boo in here!” Everyone, from Thompson to Depp’s landscaper Ego Nwodim and worker Chris Redd, refuse to clean it up “I know it’s not the most pertinent story of the moment,” Kate McKinnon as MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace concedes at the beginning of the sketch. “But with all of the problems in the world, isn’t it nice to have a news story we can all collectively watch and say, ‘Ooh, glad it ain’t me’?” Check it out in the video up top.
