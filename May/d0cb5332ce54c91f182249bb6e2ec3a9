Picture this: It’s a hot summer day and you’re trying to go on a walk to clear your head. You know you’re not going to be shopping or stopping for a coffee, so you don’t need to lug around a huge bag. You just want to bring your water bottle to stay hydrated in the heat. But trying to carry your water bottle, phone, keys and wallet by hand isn’t comfortable. You need a water bottle bag, a minimalist sling that only has room for the absolute essentials. And boy, do I have good news for you.  Whether it’s called a bottle bag, a bottle sling or a little slice of heaven, the water bottle shoulder bag is the warm weather accessory you need this summer. Rather than throwing your water bottle in a purse or canvas tote and risk having it leak all over your phone and AirPods, these bags keep your water bottle upright, so you’ll never have an untimely spill.  To help you find your own bottle bag, we’ve rounded up our favorite options ranging in color, size, style and functionality. Some have full zipped pouches for your wallet and phone and some are simply for holding your water bottle (and making your outfit look extra amazing). Each bag listed is stated to fit “most” water bottles, but it if you have a particularly large or different shaped bottle, you may want to ensure the bag is the right fit before buying.
