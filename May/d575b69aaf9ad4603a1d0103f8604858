The only thing worse than bringing sand into your house is bringing in mildew and mold from a damp beach bag. If you wait all year for long summer days at the pool or lake, a waterproof beach bag will keep all your valuables dry and clean. Unlike canvas toes or nylon backpacks, these waterproof bags are made to be taken on boat rides and kayak trips. They’re durable and versatile, to carry towels, towels, snacks, sunscreen and more for you and your whole family.  To help you step up your summer travel game, we’ve rounded up the best waterproof beach bags and backpacks. Some float in water, some can be cleaned with a hose and some have a built-in waterproof speaker to keep the party going.  HuffPost may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.
