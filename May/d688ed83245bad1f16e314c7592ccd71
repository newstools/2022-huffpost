Along with the post, Tisdale uploaded a few hilarious throwback pics of herself on the red carpet that act as a time capsule for Y2K fashion. The photos are mostly from her early Disney days from about 2004 to 2006 and feature items and trends from that truly bonkers era of fashion, including Ugg boots, pants under skirts, skinny scarves, and bubble-gum pink accessories. During this period, Tisdale also seemed to be a huge fan of low-rise jeans, chunky belts and sequined shrugs, which totally makes sense because they were all the rage at the time.
