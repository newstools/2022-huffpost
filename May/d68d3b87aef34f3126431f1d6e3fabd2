Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D) announced Sunday that he was admitted to a hospital after having a stroke amid his campaign for the U.S. Senate. The 52-year-old, in a statement and video message posted to social media, said he is “well on my way to a full recovery” and he doesn’t expect his hospitalization to deter his campaign before Pennsylvania’s primary on Tuesday. “The good news is I’m feeling much better, and the doctors tell me I didn’t suffer any cognitive damage. I’m well on my way to a full recovery. So I have a lot to be thankful for,” he said in the statement. Fetterman said he went to a hospital Friday to get checked out at the urging of his wife after he had been not feeling well. There, doctors determined that he had a stroke from a blood clot in his heart that was caused from being in atrial fibrillation for too long. Atrial fibrillation, also known as Afib, is when a heart beats irregularly, which can cause blood to collect in the heart’s chambers and form clots, according to the Mayo Clinic. “The amazing doctors here were able to quickly and completely remove the clot, reversing the stroke, they got my heart under control as well. It’s a good reminder to listen to your body and be aware of the signs,” he said in the statement.
