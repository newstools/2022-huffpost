Far-right Rep. Madison Cawthorn’s tweet evoking veterans backfired. The North Carolina Republican appeared to criticize House approval of $40 billion in aid for Ukraine with this post on Wednesday: In response, he received a series of searing reminders of his own votes against bills that assist former U.S. military service members. “DON’T EVEN pretend you care about Veterans,” responded VoteVets, a progressive PAC promoting Democratic military veterans for Congress. Other critics remembered Cawthorn’s misleading campaign ads that sought to spin his rejection by the U.S. Naval Academy.
