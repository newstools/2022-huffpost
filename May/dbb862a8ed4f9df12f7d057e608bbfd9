Arizona Cardinals cornerback Jeff Gladney, a former first-round pick of the Minnesota Vikings, died Monday at the age of 25. Gladney’s agent Brian Overstreet confirmed to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram that the NFL player was killed in a car accident early Monday morning. “We are asking prayers for the family and privacy at this most difficult time,” Overstreet said. Details of the incident have not yet been revealed. News of Gladney’s death was first made public by Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Jalen Reagor, who played with Gladney at Texas Christian University. “Lost my Brother, my best friend, my right hand man ain’t too much more I can take man damn,” Reagor wrote on Twitter. “R.I.P Jeff Gladney, brother watch over me please.” The Cardinals also released a statement Monday about Gladney’s death. “We are devastated to learn of Jeff Gladney’s passing. Our hearts go out to his family, friends and all who are mourning this tremendous loss.” TCU athletic director Jeremiah Donati also sent a statement to the Star-Telegram saying that the school’s football program “was very devastated” to learn of Gladney’s death. “After earning his degree and continuing his playing career in the NFL, Jeff maintained his close ties to TCU,” the statement read. “He loved everything about his alma mater. He was a frequent visitor to campus and was at our spring practices and spring game this year, proudly joined by his young son.” Gladney appeared to be getting his NFL career back on track after sitting out the 2021 season. He was a first-round pick out of TCU in 2020 by the Minnesota Vikings, who released him last August after he was indicted on a charge of assault involving a former girlfriend in April 2021. Gladney was found not guilty of the charge in March and signed with the Arizona Cardinals.
