Elon Musk wants Donald Trump back on Twitter, but that doesn’t mean he’s in favor of Trump retaking the White House. “Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter,” tweeted the billionaire Tesla CEO, who said Friday he’s pausing his $44 billion purchase of the platform but “remains committed.” Musk suggested on Thursday that President Joe Biden was elected because people wanted a break from the nonstop controversies of the Trump administration. “Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country,” he wrote, adding: “But actually everyone just wanted less drama.” Musk, a self-described champion of “free speech,” has said he’ll take Twitter private on completion of his purchase. Twitter banned Trump in January 2021 for inciting the U.S. Capitol riot. He frequently used the platform to peddle lies, attack enemies and divide the nation. Last week, Musk claimed Trump’s removal from Twitter was a mistake. “I think it was a morally bad decision to be clear and foolish in the extreme,” he said, adding it “alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice.” Trump, though, has said he won’t return to Twitter and instead will focus on using his own struggling Truth Social network. He is yet to officially declare his candidacy for 2024, despite teasing the prospect ever since losing the 2020 vote.
