The final seven episodes of the critically acclaimed crime drama premiered on April 29, catapulting the show back to the top of the trending list. “Ozark” stars Jason Bateman and Laura Linney as Marty and Wendy Byrde, a married couple from Chicago who relocate their family to Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri as part of a money-laundering scheme for a Mexican drug cartel.
