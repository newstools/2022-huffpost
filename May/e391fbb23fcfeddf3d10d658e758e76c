I was engaging in my usual nighttime routine (aka browsing the Target website) when I stumbled upon a landing page dedicated to Black-owned and founded businesses. The page functions as an incredible resource for discovering new brands that range from haircare and cosmetics to gluten-free snacks and revolutionary feminine care products. Scroll below to check out just some of the brands we’re bookmarking and shopping from right now. Please excuse me as I purchase the Mented Cosmetics semi-matte lipstick in every shade.
