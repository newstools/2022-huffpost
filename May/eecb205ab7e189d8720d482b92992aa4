A colorful new coin has been minted to mark the 50th anniversary of the LGBTQ pride movement in the United Kingdom. London artist Dominique Holmes designed the 50-pence piece, which was a collaboration between the U.K.’s Royal Mint and the Pride in London group. The colors of the pride flag feature alongside the values of Pride in London: protest, visibility, unity and equality. The transgender community is represented via white, pink and blue stripes. Queer people of color are honored with black and brown ones. The coins will not be introduced into general circulation, but will be available to buy online. “It humbles me greatly that the words that I coined for the brand ... will be on an actual coin, opposite the Queen,” said Asad Shaykh, Pride in London’s director of marketing and communications. “This queer brown immigrant has come a long way, powered by hope, love and this city,” Shaykh added in a statement the Royal Mint shared online. “Nowhere in the world had this been possible, except the UK. Pride in London feels very proud today.”
