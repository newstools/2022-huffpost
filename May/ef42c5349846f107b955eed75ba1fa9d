Actor Sophie Turner revealed Friday that she shuts down fellow celebrities not because she doesn’t like them, but because she likes them too much. “I’m really bad around celebrities. I can’t quite fathom that I’m actually invited to these things and I’m not a competition winner,” the “Game of Thrones” alum told “The Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon of the high-profile bashes she attends. “Every celebrity I come into contact with, I like act up or say something stupid and recently it’s been, if a celebrity interacts with me, I immediately just shut them down and I’m like, ‘I don’t want anything to do with you,’” Turner explained. Turner recalled rejecting model and reality-TV star Kendall Jenner’s invitation to an after-party at this year’s Met Gala. “I love the Kardashians but I think she’s so gorgeous in real life and I was so struck by her beauty. They were having this low-key after-party, she went, ‘Do you want to come?’ and I just went, ‘No. No. No, I don’t.’” “Why do I do this to myself?” she asked. Watch the interview here:
