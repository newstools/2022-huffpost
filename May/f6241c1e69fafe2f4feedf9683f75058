Calling all cinephiles! It’s your last chance to stream some critically acclaimed films on Netflix. Nearly 130 titles are joining the streaming platform in June, but 28 are set to depart. That includes Academy Award-winning movies like “Her,” “Memoirs of a Geisha,” and “My Fair Lady” ― all of which leave on June 30. Other award winners on the way out are “Lady Bird” (June 2), “Silver Linings Playbook” (June 17) and “Into the Wild” (June 30). Some shows are also getting the boot next month. The historical drama “Reign” will only be available until June 23, and the police procedural “Criminal Minds” is set to depart on June 29. On the lighter side, Netflix is also losing the mockumentary series “Documentary Now!” (June 2) and the comedy-drama “Girlfriends’ Guide to Divorce.” Check out the full list of movies and shows leaving Netflix below.
