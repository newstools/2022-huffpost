“The Lincoln Lawyer” is the most popular show on Netflix for the second week in a row, according to the streaming service’s public ranking system. This new legal drama from David E. Kelley is based on Michael Connelly’s 2008 novel “The Brass Verdict” — the sequel to the novel “The Lincoln Lawyer — and features 10 episodes ranging from 45 to 56 minutes long. The series stars Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Neve Campbell and Becki Newton and follows a defense attorney who works from the back of a chauffeur-driven Lincoln Town Car. “Ozark” is again in second place, following the premiere of the crime drama’s final seven episodes on April 29.
