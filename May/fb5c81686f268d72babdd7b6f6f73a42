Samantha Bee did not enjoy her hiatus. The “Full Frontal” host returned Thursday, noting that her show’s first day of break coincided with the publication of the explosive Supreme Court draft opinion in favor of gutting Roe v. Wade. “Just a beautiful day to kick back and enjoy the sun and burn our throats to dust with endless screaming,” Bee said. Bee described the draft majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, as infuriating. “Not just because it strips away reproductive rights. Justice Alito’s opinion cites a shithead from the 17th goddamn century who defended marital rape and had women executed for witchcraft,” she said. Alito argued in favor of overturning the landmark because, according to him: “The inescapable conclusion is that the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nation’s history and traditions.” “You know what else isn’t mentioned in the Constitution?” Bee asked. “Cars or hamburgers or fuckin’ Brazzers.” Next, Bee directed her ire at Republicans who’ve clutched their pearls over pro-choice protesters demonstrating outside the homes of Supreme Court justices and lawmakers. “Pardon me, but in my civilest way possible, may I humbly request that you fuck the fuck off?” she said. “How dare Republicans demand civility as they strip away our civil rights?!?” Watch Bee’s full monologue below:
